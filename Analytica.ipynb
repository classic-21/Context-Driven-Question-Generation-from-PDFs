The classes were\\nfree of charge. Generally the Swami held two classes daily- morning\\nand evening.\\nAlthough the Swami delivered many lectures and held numerous classes\\nin the two years and five months he had been in America, these lectures\\nconstituted a departure in the way they were recorded. Just prior to the\\ncommencement of his Winter -95-96 season in NYC, his friends and\\nsupporters aided him by advertising for and ultimately hiring a\\nprofessional stenographer: The man selected, Joseph Josiah Goodwin,\\nlater became a disciple of the Swami and followed him to England andGoodwin's transcriptions of the Swami's lectures form the basis of five\\nbooks.\\nCHAPTER 1\\nKarma in its effect on\\ncharacter\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (2 of\", 'The word Karma is derived from the Sanskrit Kri, to do; all action\\nis Karma. Technically, this word also means the effects of actions.\\nIn connection with metaphysics, it sometimes means the effects,\\nof which our past actions were the causes. But in Karma-Yoga we\\nhave simply to do with the word Karma as meaning work. The\\ngoal of mankind is knowledge. That is the one ideal placed before\\nus by Eastern philosophy. Pleasure is not the goal of man, but\\nknowledge. Pleasure and happiness come to an end. It is a mistake\\nto suppose that pleasure is the goal. The cause of all the miseries\\nwe have in the world is that men foolishly think pleasure to be the\\nideal to strive for. After a time man finds that it is not happiness,\\nbut knowledge, towards which he is going, and that both pleasure\\nand pain are great teachers, and that he learns as much from evil\\nas from good. As pleasure and pain pass before his soul they have\\nupon it different pictures, and the result of these combined\\nimpressions is what is called man\\'s \"character\". If you take the\\ncharacter of any man, it really is but the aggregate of tendencies,\\nthe sum total of the bent of his mind; you will find that misery and\\nhappiness are equal factors in the formation of that character.\\nGood and evil have an equal share in moulding character, and in\\nsome instances misery is a greater teacher than happiness. In\\nstudying the great characters the world has produced, I dare say, in\\nthe vast majority of cases, it would be found that it was misery\\nthat taught more than happiness, it was poverty that taught more\\nthan wealth, it was blows that brought out their inner fire more\\nthan praise.\\nNow this knowledge, again, is inherent in man. No knowledge\\ncomes from outside; it is all inside. What we say a man \"knows\",\\nshould, in strict psychological language, be what he \"discovers\" or\\n\"unveils\"; what a man \"learns\" is really what he \"discovers\", by\\ntaking the cover off his own soul, which is a mine of infinite\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (3 of', 'knowledge.\\nWe say Newton discovered gravitation. Was it sitting anywhere in\\na corner waiting for him? It was in his own mind; the time came\\nand he found it out. All knowledge that the world has ever\\nreceived comes from the mind; the infinite library of the universe\\nis in your own mind. The external world is simply the suggestion,\\nthe occasion, which sets you to study your own mind, but the\\nobject of your study is always your own mind. The falling of an\\napple gave the suggestion to Newton, and he studied his own\\nmind. He rearranged all the previous links of thought in his mind\\nand discovered a new link among them, which we call the law of\\ngravitation. It was not in the apple nor in anything in the centre of\\nthe earth.\\nAll knowledge, therefore, secular or spiritual, is in the human\\nmind. In many cases it is not discovered, but remains covered, and\\nwhen the covering is being slowly taken off, we say, \"We are\\nlearning,\" and the advance of knowledge is made by the advance\\nof this process of uncovering. The man from whom this veil is\\nbeing lifted is the more knowing man, the man upon whom it lies\\nthick is ignorant, and the man from whom it has entirely gone is\\nall-knowing, omniscient. There have been omniscient men, and, I\\nbelieve, there will be yet; and that there will be myriads of them in\\nthe cycles to come. Like fire in a piece of flint, knowledge exists\\nin the mind; suggestion is the friction which brings it out. So with\\nall our feelings and actions--our tears and our smiles, our joys and\\nour griefs, our weeping and our laughter, our curses and our\\nblessings, our praises and our blames--every one of these we may\\nfind, if we calmly study our own selves, to have been brought out\\nfrom within ourselves by so many blows. The result is what we\\nare. All these blows taken together are called Karma--work,\\naction. Every mental and physical blow that is given to the soul,\\nby which, as it were, fire is struck from it, and by which its own\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (4 of', 'power and knowledge are discovered, is Karma, this word being\\nused in its widest sense. Thus we are all doing Karma all the time.\\nI am talking to you: that is Karma. You are listening: that is\\nKarma. We breathe: that is Karma. We walk: Karma. Everything\\nwe do, physical or mental, is Karma, and it leaves its marks on us.\\nThere are certain works which are, as it were, the aggregate, the\\nsum total, of a large number of smaller works.

Each one of\\nthese is making a noise, and yet we do not catch it; it is only when\\nthey become the big aggregate that we hear. Similarly, every\\npulsation of the heart is work. Certain kinds of work we feel and\\nthey become tangible to us; they are, at the same time, the\\naggregate of a number of small works. If you really want to judge\\nof the character of a man, look not at his great performances.\\nEvery fool may become a hero at one time or another.

Great\\noccasions rouse even the lowest of human beings to some kind of\\ngreatness, but he alone is the really great man whose character is\\ngreat always, the same wherever he be.\\nKarma in its effect on character is the most tremendous power\\nthan man has to deal with. Man is, as it were, a centre, and is\\nattracting all the powers of the universe towards himself, and in\\nthis centre is fusing them all and again sending them off in a big\\ncurrent. Such a centre is the real man--the almighty, the\\nomniscient--and he draws the whole universe towards him. Good\\nand bad, misery and happiness, all are running towards him and\\nclinging round him; and out of them he fashions the mighty stream\\nof tendency called character and throws it outwards.

When a\\nman does something very good there, they give a title of nobility\\nto his father, who is dead, or to his grandfather. Some people work\\nfor that.

In the\\nfirst place, a man who can work for five days, or even for five\\nminutes, without any selfish motive whatever, without thinking of\\nfuture, of heaven, of punishment, or anything of the kind, has in\\nhim the capacity to become a powerful moral giant.

These as\\nmanifested in the physical world are what we may call\\nequilibrium, activity, and inertness. Tamas is typified as darkness\\nor inactivity; Rajas is activity, expressed as attraction or repulsion;\\nand Sattva is the equilibrium of the two. In every man there are\\nthese three forces. Sometimes Tamas prevails. We become lazy,\\nwe cannot move, we are inactive, bound down by certain ideas or\\nby mere dullness. At other times activity prevails, and at still other\\ntimes that calm balancing of both. Again, in different men, one of\\nthese forces is generally predominant. The characteristic of one\\nman is inactivity, dullness and laziness; that of another, activity,\\npower, manifestation of energy; and in still another we find the\\nsweetness, calmness, and gentleness, which are due to the\\nbalancing of both action and inaction. So in all creation--in\\nanimals, plants, and men--we find the more or less typical\\nmanifestation of all these different forces.\\nKarma-Yoga has specially to deal with these three factors. By\\nteaching what they are and how to employ them, it helps us to do\\nour work better. Human society is a graded organisation. We all\\nknow about morality, and we all know about duty, but at the same\\ntime we find that in different countries the significance of\\nmorality varies greatly. What is regarded as moral in one country\\nmay in another be considered perfectly immoral. For instance, in\\none country cousins may marry; in another, it is thought to be very\\nimmoral; in one, men may marry their sisters-in-law; in another, it\\nis regarded as immoral; in one country people may marry only\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (11 of', 'once; in another, many times; and so forth. Similarly, in all other\\ndepartments of morality, we find the standard varies greatly- yet\\nwe have the idea that there must be a universal standard of\\nmorality.\\nSo it is with duty. The idea of duty varies much among different\\nnations. In one country, if a man does not do certain things, people\\nwill say he has acted wrongly; while if he does those very things\\nin another country, people will say that he did not act rightly--and\\nyet we know that there must be some universal idea of duty. In the\\nsame way, one class of society thinks that certain things are\\namong its duty, while another class thinks quite the opposite and\\nwould be horrified if it had to do those things. Two ways are left\\nopen to us--the way of the ignorant, who think that there is only\\none way to truth and that all the rest are wrong, and the way of the\\nwise, who admit that, according to our mental constitution or the\\ndifferent planes of existence in which we are, duty and morality\\nmay vary. The important thing is to know that there are gradations\\nof duty and of morality--that the duty of one state of life, in one\\nset of circumstances, will not and cannot be that of another.\\nTo illustrate: All great teachers have taught, \"Resist not evil,\" that\\nnon-resistance is the highest moral ideal. We all know that, if a\\ncertain number of us attempted to put that maxim fully into\\npractice, the whole social fabric would fall to pieces, the wicked\\nwould take possession of our properties and our lives, and would\\ndo whatever they like with us. Even if only one day of such non-\\nresistance were practised, it would lead to disaster. Yet,\\nintuitively, in our heart of hearts we feel the truth of the teaching\\n\"Resist not evil.\" This seems to us to be the highest ideal; yet to\\nteach this doctrine only would be equivalent to condemning a vast\\nportion of mankind. Not only so, it would be making men feel that\\nthey were always doing wrong, and cause in them scruples of\\nconscience in all their actions; it would weaken them, and that\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (12 of', 'constant self-disapproval would breed more vice than any other\\nweakness would. To the man who has begun to hate himself the\\ngate to degeneration has already opened; and the same is true of a\\nnation. Our first duty is not to hate ourselves, because to advance\\nwe must have faith in ourselves first and then in God. He who has\\nno faith in himself can never have faith in God. Therefore, the\\nonly alternative remaining to us is to recognise that duty and\\nmorality vary under different circumstances; not that the man who\\nresists evil is doing what is always and in itself wrong, but that in\\nthe different circumstances in which he is placed it may become\\neven his duty to resist evil.\\nIn reading the Bhagavad-Gita, many of you in Western countries\\nmay have felt astonished at the second chapter, wherein Sri\\nKrishna calls Arjuna a hypocrite and a coward because of his\\nrefusal to fight, or offer resistance, on account of his adversaries\\nbeing his friends and relatives, making the plea that non-resistance\\nwas the highest ideal of love. This is a great lesson for us all to\\nlearn, that in all matters the two extremes are alike. The extreme\\npositive and the extreme negative are always similar. When the\\nvibrations of light are too slow, we do not see them, nor do we see\\nthem when they are too rapid. So with sound; when very low in\\npitch, we do not hear it; when very high, we do not hear it either.\\nOf like nature is the difference between resistance and non-\\nresistance. One man does not resist because he is weak, lazy, and\\ncannot, not because he will not; the other man knows that he can\\nstrike an irresistible blow if he likes; yet he not only does not\\nstrike, but blesses his enemies. The one who from weakness\\nresists not commits a sin, and as such cannot receive any benefit\\nfrom the non-resistance; while the other would commit a sin by\\noffering resistance. Buddha gave up his throne and renounced his\\nposition, that was true renunciation; but there cannot be any\\nquestion of renunciation in the case of a beggar who has nothing\\nto renounce.

Arjuna became a coward at the sight of\\nthe mighty array against him; his \"love\" make him forget his duty\\ntowards his country and king. That is why Sri Krishna told him\\nthat he was a hypocrite; Thou talkest like a wise man, but thy\\nactions betray thee to be a coward; therefore stand up and fight!\\nSuch is the central idea of Karma-Yoga. The Karma-Yogi is the\\nman who understands that the highest ideal is non-resistance, and\\nwho also knows that this non-resistance is the highest\\nmanifestation of power in actual possession, and also what is\\ncalled the resisting of evil is but a step on the way towards the\\nmanifestation of this highest power, namely, non-resistance.\\nBefore reaching this highest ideal, man\\'s duty is to resist evil; let\\nhim work, let him fight, let him strike straight from the shoulder.\\nThen only, when he has gained the power to resist, will non-\\nresistance be a virtue.\\nI once met a man in my country whom I had known before as a\\nvery stupid, dull person, who knew nothing and had not the desire\\nto know anything, and was living the life of a brute.

When the eyes of\\nsociety are turned towards us, we may make a show of non-\\nresistance, but in our hearts it is canker all the time. We feel the\\nutter want of the calm of non-resistance; we feel that it would be\\nbetter for us to resist. If you desire wealth, and know at the same\\ntime that the whole world regards him who aims at wealth as a\\nvery wicked man, you, perhaps, will not dare to plunge into the\\nstruggle for wealth, yet your mind will be running day and night\\nafter money.

Spiritual knowledge is the only thing that can destroy\\nour miseries for ever; any other knowledge satisfies wants only\\nfor a time. It is only with the knowledge of the spirit that the\\nfaculty of want is annihilated for ever; so helping man spiritually\\nis the highest help that can be given to him.

Next to spiritual comes intellectual help. The gift\\nof knowledge is a far higher gift than that of food and clothes; it is\\neven higher than giving life to a man, because the real life of man\\nconsists of knowledge. Ignorance is death, knowledge is life. Life\\nis of very little value, if it is a life in the dark, groping through\\nignorance and misery. Next in order comes, of course, helping a\\nman physically. Therefore, in considering the question of helping\\nothers, we must always strive not to commit the mistake of\\nthinking that physical help is the only help that can be given. It is\\nnot only the last but the least, because it cannot bring about\\npermanent satisfaction. The misery that I feel when I am hungry is\\nsatisfied by eating, but hunger returns; my misery can cease only\\nwhen I am satisfied beyond all want. Then hunger will not make\\nme miserable; no distress, no sorrow will be able to move me. So,\\nthat help which tends to make us strong spiritually is the highest,\\nnext to it comes intellectual help, and after that physical help.\\nThe miseries of the world cannot be cured by physical help only.\\nUntil man's nature changes, these physical needs will always\\narise, and miseries will always be felt, and no amount of physical\\nhelp will cure them completely. The only solution of this problem\\nis to make mankind pure. Ignorance is the mother of all the evil\\nand all the misery we see. Let men have light, let them be pure\\nand spiritually strong and educated, then alone will misery cease\\nin the world, not before. We may convert every house in the\\ncountry into a charity asylum, we may fill the land with hospitals,\\nbut the misery of man will still continue to exist until man's\\ncharacter changes.\\nWe read in the Bhagavad Gita again and again that we must all\\nwork incessantly. All work is by nature composed of good and\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (27 of\", 'evil. We cannot do any work which will not do some good\\nsomewhere; there cannot be any work which will not cause some\\nharm somewhere. Every work must necessarily be a mixture of\\ngood and evil; yet we are commanded to work incessantly. Good\\nand evil will both have their results, will produce their Karma.\\nGood action will entail upon us good effect; bad action, bad. But\\ngood and bad are both bondages of the soul. The solution reached\\nin the Gita in regard to this bondage-producing nature of work is\\nthat, if we do not attach ourselves to the work we do, it will not\\nhave any binding effect on our soul. We shall try to understand\\nwhat is meant by this \"non-attachment\" to work.\\nThis is the one central idea in the Gita: work incessantly, but be\\nnot attached to it. Samskara can be translated very nearly by\\n\"inherent tendency\". Using the simile of a lake for the mind, every\\nripple, every wave that rises in the mind, when it subsides, does\\nnot die out entirely, but leaves a mark and a future possibility of\\nthat wave coming out again. This mark, with the possibility of the\\nwave reappearing, is what is called Samskara. Every work that we\\ndo, every movement of the body, every thought that we think,\\nleaves such an impression on the mind-stuff, and even when such\\nimpressions are not obvious on the surface, they are sufficiently\\nstrong to work beneath the surface, subconsciously. What we are\\nevery moment is determined by the sum total of these impressions\\non the mind. What I am just at this moment is the effect of the\\nsum total of all the impressions of my past life. This is really what\\nis meant by character; each man\\'s character is determined by the\\nsum total of these impressions. If good impressions prevail, the\\ncharacter becomes good; if bad, it becomes bad. If a man\\ncontinuously hears bad words, thinks bad thoughts, does bad\\nactions, his mind will be full of bad impressions; and they will\\ninfluence his thought and work without his being conscious of the\\nfact. In fact, these bad impressions are always working, and their\\nresultant must be evil, and that man will be a bad man; he cannot\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (28 of', \"help it. The sum total of these impressions in him will create the\\nstrong motive power for doing bad actions. He will be like a\\nmachine in the hand of his impressions, and they will force him to\\ndo evil. Similarly, if a man thinks good thoughts and does good\\nworks, the sum total of these impressions will be good; and they,\\nin a similar manner, will force him to do good even in spite of\\nhimself. When a man has done so much good work and thought so\\nmany good thoughts that there is an irresistible tendency in him to\\ndo good, in spite of himself and even if he wishes to do evil, his\\nmind, as the sum total of his tendencies, will not allow him to do\\nso; the tendencies will turn him back; he is completely under the\\ninfluence of the good tendencies. When such is the case, a man's\\ngood character is said to be established.\\nAs the tortoise tucks its feet and head inside the shell, and you\\nmay kill it and break it in pieces, and yet it will not come out,\\neven so the character of that man who has control over his\\nmotives and organs is unchangeably established. He controls his\\nown inner forces, and nothing can draw them out against his will.\\nBy this continuous reflex of good thoughts, good impressions\\nmoving over the surface of the mind, the tendency for doing good\\nbecomes strong, and as the result we feel able to control the\\nIndriyas (the sense-organs, the nerve-centres). Thus alone will\\ncharacter be established, then alone a man gets to truth. Such a\\nman is safe for ever; he cannot do any evil. You may place him in\\nany company, there will be no danger for him. There is a still\\nhigher state than having this good tendency, and that is the desire\\nfor liberation. You must remember that freedom of the soul is the\\ngoal of all Yogas, and each one equally leads to the same result.\\nBy work alone men may get to where Buddha got largely by\\nmeditation or Christ by prayer. Buddha was a working Jnani,\\nChrist was a Bhakta, but the same goal was reached by both of\\nthem. The difficulty is here. Liberation means entire freedom--\\nfreedom from the bondage of good, as well as from the bondage\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (29 of\", 'of evil.

He\\nsaid to those around, \"You are all liars; this is no sacrifice.\"\\n\"What!\" they exclaimed, \"you say this is no sacrifice; do you not\\nknow how money and jewels were poured out to the poor and\\nevery one became rich and happy? This was the most wonderful\\nsacrifice any man every performed.\" But the mongoose said,\\n\"There was once a little village, and in it there dwelt a poor\\nBrahmin with his wife, his son, and his son\\'s wife. They were very\\npoor and lived on small gifts made to them for preaching and\\nteaching. There came in that land a three years\\' famine, and the\\npoor Brahmin suffered more than ever. At last when the family\\nhad starved for days, the father brought home one morning a little\\nbarley flour, which he had been fortunate enough to obtain, and he\\ndivided it into four parts, one for each member of the family. They\\nprepared it for their meal, and just as they were about to eat, there\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (34 of', 'was a knock at the door. The father opened it, and there stood a\\nguest. Now in India a guest is a sacred person; he is as a god for\\nthe time being, and must be treated as such. So the poor Brahmin\\nsaid, \"Come in, sir; you are welcome.\" He set before the guest his\\nown portion of the food, which the guest quickly ate and said,\\n\"Oh, sir, you have killed me; I have been starving for ten days,\\nand this little bit has but increased my hunger.\" Then the wife said\\nto her husband, \"Give him my share,\" but the husband said, \"Not\\nso.\" The wife however insisted, saying, \"Here is a poor man, and\\nit is our duty as householders to see that he is fed, and it is my\\nduty as a wife to give him my portion, seeing that you have no\\nmore to offer him.\" Then she gave her share to the guest, which he\\nate, and said he was still burning with hunger. So the son said,\\n\"Take my portion also; it is the duty of a son to help his father to\\nfulfil his obligation.\" The guest ate that, but remained still\\nunsatisfied; so the son\\'s wife gave him her portion also. That was\\nsufficient, and the guest departed, blessing them. That night those\\nfour people died of starvation. A few granules of that flour had\\nfallen on the floor; and when I rolled my body on them, half of it\\nbecame golden, as you see. Since then I have been travelling all\\nover the world, hoping to find another sacrifice like that, but\\nnowhere have I found one; nowhere else has the other half of my\\nbody been turned into gold. That is why I say this is no sacrifice.\"\\nThis idea of charity is going out of India; great men are becoming\\nfewer and fewer. When I was first learning English, I read an\\nEnglish story book in which there was a story about a dutiful boy\\nwho had gone out to work and had given some of his money to his\\nold mother, and this was praised in three or four pages. What was\\nthat? No Hindu boy can ever understand the moral of that story.\\nNow I understand it when I hear the Western idea--every man for\\nhimself. And some men take everything for themselves, and\\nfathers and mothers and wives and children go to the wall. That\\nshould never and nowhere be the ideal of the householder.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (35 of', 'Now you see what Karma-Yoga means; even at the point of death\\nto help any one, without asking questions. Be cheated millions of\\ntimes and never ask a question, and never think of what you are\\ndoing. Never vaunt of your gifts to the poor or expect their\\ngratitude, but rather be grateful to them for giving you the\\noccasion of practising charity to them. Thus it is plain that to be\\nan ideal householder is a much more difficult task than to be an\\nideal Sannyasin; the true life of work is indeed as hard as, if not\\nharder than, the equally true life of renunciation.\\nCHAPTER 4\\nWhat is Duty\\nIt is necessary in the study of Karma-Yoga to know what duty is.\\nIf I have to do something I must first know that it is my duty, and\\nthen I can do it. The idea of duty again is different in different\\nnations. The Mohammedan says what is written in his book, the\\nKoran, is his duty; the Hindu says what is in the Vedas is his duty;\\nand the Christian says what is in the Bible is his duty. We find that\\nthere are varied ideas of duty, differing according to different\\nstates in life, different historical periods and different nations. The\\nterm \"duty\", like every other universal abstract term, is impossible\\nclearly to define; we can only get an idea of it by knowing its\\npractical operations and results. When certain things occur before\\nus, we have all a natural or trained impulse to act in a certain\\nmanner towards them; when this impulse comes, the mind begins\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (36 of', 'to think about the situation. Sometimes it thinks that it is good to\\nact in a particular manner under the given conditions; at other\\ntimes it thinks that it is wrong to act in the same manner even in\\nthe very same circumstances. The ordinary idea of duty\\neverywhere is that every good man follows the dictates of his\\nconscience. But what is it that makes an act a duty? If a Christian\\nfinds a piece of beef before him and does not eat it to save his own\\nlife, or will not give it to save the life of another man, he is sure to\\nfeel that he has not done his duty. But if a Hindu dares to eat that\\npiece of beef or to give it to another Hindu, he is equally sure to\\nfeel that he too has not done his duty; the Hindu\\'s training and\\neducation make him feel that way. In the last century there were\\nnotorious bands of robbers in India called thugs; they thought it\\ntheir duty to kill any man they could and take away his money; the\\nlarger the number of men they killed, the better they thought they\\nwere. Ordinarily if a man goes out into the street and shoots down\\nanother man, he is apt to feel sorry for it, thinking that he has done\\nwrong. But if the very same man, as a soldier in his regiment, kills\\nnot one but twenty, he is certain to feel glad and think that he has\\ndone his duty remarkable well. Therefore we see that it is not the\\nthing done that defines a duty. To give an objective definition of\\nduty is thus entirely impossible. Yet there is duty from the\\nsubjective side. Any action that makes us go Godward is a good\\naction, and is our duty; any action that makes us go downward is\\nevil, and is not our duty. From the subjective standpoint we may\\nsee that certain acts have a tendency to exalt and ennoble us, while\\ncertain other acts have a tendency to degrade and to brutalise us.\\nBut it is not possible to make out with certainty which acts have\\nwhich kind of tendency in relation to all persons, of all sorts and\\nconditions. There is, however, only one idea of duty which has\\nbeen universally accepted by all mankind, of all ages and sects\\nand countries, and that has been summed up in a Sanskrit\\naphorism thus: \"Do not injure any being; not injuring any being is\\nvirtue, injuring any being is sin.\"\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (37 of', 'The Bhagavad Gita frequently alludes to duties dependent upon\\nbirth and position in life. Birth and position in life and in society\\nlargely determine the mental and moral attitude of individuals\\ntowards the various activities of life. It is therefore our duty to do\\nthat work which will exalt and ennoble us in accordance with the\\nideals and activities of the society in which we are born. But it\\nmust be particularly remembered that the same ideals and\\nactivities do not prevail in all societies and countries; our\\nignorance of this is the main cause of much of the hatred of one\\nnation towards another. An American thinks that whatever an\\nAmerican does in accordance with the custom of his country is the\\nbest thing to do, and that whoever does not follow his custom\\nmust be a very wicked man. A Hindu thinks that his customs are\\nthe only right ones and are the best in the world, and that\\nwhosoever does not obey them must be the most wicked man\\nliving. This is quite a natural mistake which all of us are apt to\\nmake. But it is very harmful; it is the cause of half the\\nuncharitableness found in the world. When I came to this country\\nand was going through the Chicago Fair, a man from behind\\npulled at my turban. I looked back and saw that he was a very\\ngentlemanly-looking man, neatly dressed. I spoke to him; and\\nwhen he found that I knew English, he became very much\\nabashed. On another occasion in the same Fair another man gave\\nme a push. When I asked him the reason, he also was ashamed\\nand stammered out an apology saying, \"Why do you dress that\\nway?\" The sympathies of these men were limited within the range\\nof their own language and their own fashion of dress. Much of the\\noppression of powerful nations on weaker ones is caused by this\\nprejudice. It dries up their fellow-feeling for fellow men. That\\nvery man who asked me why I did not dress as he did and wanted\\nto ill-treat me because of my dress may have been a very good\\nman, a good father, and a good citizen; but the kindliness of his\\nnature died out as soon as he saw a man in a different dress.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (38 of', 'Strangers are exploited in all countries, because they do not know\\nhow to defend themselves; thus they carry home false impressions\\nof the peoples they have seen. Sailors, soldiers, and traders behave\\nin foreign lands in very queer ways, although they would not\\ndream of doing so in their own country; perhaps this is why the\\nChinese call Europeans and Americans \"foreign devils\". They\\ncould not have done this if they had met the good, the kindly sides\\nof Western life.\\nTherefore the one point we ought to remember is that we should\\nalways try to see the duty of others through their own eyes, and\\nnever judge the customs of other peoples by our own standard. I\\nam not the standard of the universe. I have to accommodate\\nmyself to the world, and not the world to me. So we see that\\nenvironments change the nature of our duties, and doing the duty\\nwhich is ours at any particular time is the best thing we can do in\\nthis world. Let us do that duty which is ours by birth; and when\\nwe have done that, let us do the duty which is ours by our position\\nin life and in society. There is, however, one great danger in\\nhuman nature, viz. that man never examines himself. He thinks he\\nis quite as fit to be on the throne as the king. Even if he is, he must\\nfirst show that he has done the duty of his own position; and then\\nhigher duties will come to him. When we begin to work earnestly\\nin the world, nature gives us blows right and left and soon enables\\nus to find out our position. No man can long occupy satisfactorily\\na position for which he is not fit. There is no use in grumbling\\nagainst nature\\'s adjustment. He who does the lower work is not\\ntherefore a lower man. No man is to be judged by the mere nature\\nof his duties, but all should be judged by the manner and the spirit\\nin which they perform them.\\nLater on we shall find that even this idea of duty undergoes\\nchange, and that the greatest work is done only when there is no\\nselfish motive to prompt it. Yet it is work through the sense of\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (39 of', 'duty that leads us to work without any idea of duty; when work\\nwill become worship--nay, something higher--then will work be\\ndone for its own sake. We shall find that the philosophy of duty,\\nwhether it be in the form of ethics or of love, is the same as in\\nevery other Yoga--the object being the attenuating of the lower\\nself, so that the real higher Self may shine forth--the lessening of\\nthe frittering away of energies on the lower plane of existence, so\\nthat the soul may manifest itself on the higher ones. This is\\naccomplished by the continuous denial of low desires, which duty\\nrigorously requires. The whole organisation of society has thus\\nbeen developed, consciously or unconsciously, in the realms of\\naction and experience, where, by limiting selfishness, we open the\\nway to an unlimited expansion of the real nature of man.\\nDuty is seldom sweet. It is only when love greases its wheels that\\nit runs smoothly; it is a continuous friction otherwise. How else\\ncould parents do their duties to their children, husbands to their\\nwives, and vice versa? Do we not meet with cases of friction\\nevery day in our lives? Duty is sweet only through love, and love\\nshines in freedom alone. Yet is it freedom to be a slave to the\\nsenses, to anger, to jealousies and a hundred other petty things that\\nmust occur every day in human life? In all these little roughnesses\\nthat we meet with in life, the highest expression of freedom is to\\nforbear. Women, slaves to their own irritable, jealous tempers, are\\napt to blame their husbands, and assert their own \"freedom\", as\\nthey think, not knowing that thereby they only prove that they are\\nslaves. So it is with husbands who eternally find fault with their\\nwives.\\nChastity is the first virtue in man or woman, and the man who,\\nhowever he may have strayed away, cannot be brought to the right\\npath by a gentle and loving and chaste wife is indeed very rare.\\nThe world is not yet as bad as that.

If all women were as good and pure as their own constant\\nassertions would lead one to believe, I am perfectly satisfied that\\nthere would not be one impure man in the world. What brutality is\\nthere which purity and chastity cannot conquer? A good, chaste\\nwife, who thinks of every other man except her own husband as\\nher child and has the attitude of a mother towards all men, will\\ngrow so great in the power of her purity that there cannot be a\\nsingle man, however brutal, who will not breathe an atmosphere\\nof holiness in her presence. Similarly, every husband must look\\nupon all women, except his own wife, in the light of his own\\nmother or daughter or sister. That man, again, who wants to be a\\nteacher of religion must look upon every woman as his mother,\\nand always behave towards her as such.\\nThe position of the mother is the highest in the world, as it is the\\none place in which to learn and exercise the greatest unselfishness.\\nThe love of God is the only love that is higher than a mother's\\nlove; all others are lower. It is the duty of the mother to think of\\nher children first and then of herself. But, instead of that, if the\\nparents are always thinking of themselves first, the result is that\\nthe relation between parents and children becomes the same as\\nthat between birds and their offspring which, as soon as they are\\nfledged, do not recognise any parents. Blessed, indeed, is the man\\nwho is able to look upon woman as the representative of the\\nmotherhood of God. Blessed, indeed, is the woman to whom man\\nrepresents the fatherhood of God. Blessed are the children who\\nlook upon their parents as Divinity manifested on earth.\\nThe only way to rise is by doing the duty next to us, and thus\\ngathering strength go on until we reach the highest state. A young\\nSannyasin went to a forest; there he meditated, worshipped, and\\npractised Yoga for a long time. After years of hard work and\\npractice, he was one day sitting under a tree, when some dry\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (41 of\", 'leaves fell upon his head. He looked up and saw a crow and a\\ncrane fighting on the top of the tree, which made him very angry.\\nHe said, \"What! Dare you throw these dry leaves upon my head!\"\\nAs with these words he angrily glanced at them, a flash of fire\\nwent out of his head--such was the Yogi\\'s power--and burnt the\\nbirds to ashes. He was very glad, almost overjoyed at this\\ndevelopment of power--he could burn the crow and the crane by a\\nlook. After a time he had to go to the town to beg his bread. He\\nwent, stood at a door, and said, \"Mother, give me food.\" A voice\\ncame from inside the house, \"Wait a little, my son.\" The young\\nman thought, \"You wretched woman, how dare you make me\\nwait! You do not know my power yet.\" While he was thinking\\nthus the voice came again: \"Boy, don\\'t be thinking too much of\\nyourself. Here is neither crow nor crane.\" He was astonished; still\\nhe had to wait. At last the woman came, and he fell at her feet and\\nsaid, \"Mother, how did you know that?\" She said, \"My boy, I do\\nnot know your Yoga or your practices. I am a common everyday\\nwoman. I made you wait because my husband is ill, and I was\\nnursing him. All my life I have struggled to do my duty. When I\\nwas unmarried, I did my duty to my parents; now that I am\\nmarried, I do my duty to my husband; that is all the Yoga I\\npractise. But by doing my duty I have become illumined; thus I\\ncould read your thoughts and know what you had done in the\\nforest. If you want to know something higher than this, go to the\\nmarket of such and such a town where you will find a Vyadha\\nwho will tell you something that you will be very glad to learn.\"\\nThe Sannyasin thought, \"Why should I go to that town and to a\\nVyadha?\" But after what he had seen, his mind opened a little, so\\nhe went. When he came near the town, he found the market and\\nthere saw, at a distance, a big fat Vyadha cutting meat with big\\nknives, talking and bargaining with different people. The young\\nman said, \"Lord help me! Is this the man from whom I am going\\nto learn? He is the incarnation of a demon, if he is anything.\" In\\nthe meantime this man looked up and said, \"O Swami, did that\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (42 of', 'lady send you here?

He then washed his old\\nfather and mother, fed them, and did all he could to please them,\\nafter which he came to the Sannyasin and said, \"Now, sir, you\\nhave come here to see me; what can I do for you?\" The Sannyasin\\nasked him a few questions about soul and about God, and the\\nVyadha gave him a lecture which forms a part of the\\nMahabharata, called the Vyadha Gita . It contains one of the\\nhighest flights of the Vedanta. When the Vyadha finished his\\nteaching, the Sannyasin felt astonished. He said, \"Why are you in\\nthat body? With such knowledge as yours why are you in a\\nVyadha\\'s body, and doing such filthy, ugly work?\" \"My son,\"\\nreplied the Vyadha, \"no duty is ugly, no duty is impure. My birth\\nplaced me in these circumstances and environments. In my\\nboyhood I learnt the trade; I am unattached, and I try to do my\\nduty well. I try to do my duty as a householder, and I try to do all I\\ncan to make my father and mother happy. I neither know your\\nYoga, nor have I become a Sannyasin, nor did I go out of the\\nworld into a forest; nevertheless, all that you have heard and seen\\nhas come to me through the unattached doing of the duty which\\nbelongs to my position.\"\\nThere is a sage in India, a great Yogi, one of the most wonderful\\nmen I have ever seen in my life.

We are all apt to think too highly of\\nourselves. Our duties are determined by our deserts to a much\\nlarger extent than we are willing to grant. Competition rouses\\nenvy, and it kills the kindliness of the heart. To the grumbler all\\nduties are distasteful; nothing will ever satisfy him, and his whole\\nlife is doomed to prove a failure.

In every\\nreligion there are three parts: philosophy, mythology, and ritual.\\nPhilosophy of course is the essence of every religion; mythology\\nexplains and illustrates it by means of the more or less legendary\\nlives of great men, stories and fables of wonderful things, and so\\non; ritual gives to that philosophy a still more concrete form, so\\nthat every one may grasp it--ritual is in fact concretised\\nphilosophy. This ritual is Karma; it is necessary in every religion,\\nbecause most of us cannot understand abstract spiritual things\\nuntil we grow much spiritually. It is easy for men to think that\\nthey can understand anything; but when it comes to practical\\nexperience, they find that abstract ideas are often very hard to\\ncomprehend. Therefore symbols are of great help, and we cannot\\ndispense with the symbolical method of putting things before us.\\nFrom time immemmorial symbols have been used by all kinds of\\nreligions. In one sense we cannot think but in symbols; words\\nthemselves are symbols of thought. In another sense everything in\\nthe universe may be looked upon as a symbol. The whole universe\\nis a symbol, and God is the essence behind. This kind of\\nsymbology is not simply the creation of man; it is not that certain\\npeople belonging to a religion sit down together and think out\\ncertain symbols, and bring them into existence out of their own\\nminds. The symbols of religion have a natural growth. Otherwise,\\nwhy is it that certain symbols are associated with certain ideas in\\nthe mind of almost every one? Certain symbols are universally\\nprevalent. Many of you may think that the cross first came into\\nexistence as a symbol in connection with the Christian religion,\\nbut as a matter of fact it existed before Christianity was, before\\nMoses was born, before the Vedas were given out, before there\\nwas any human record of human things. The cross may be found\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (45 of', \"to have been in existence among the Aztecs and the Phoenicians;\\nevery race seems to have had the cross. Again, the symbol of the\\ncrucified Savior, of a man crucified upon a cross, appears to have\\nbeen known to almost every nation. The circle has been a great\\nsymbol throughout the world. Then there is the most universal of\\nall symbols, the Swastika. At one time it was thought that the\\nBuddhists carried it all over the world with them, but it has been\\nfound out that ages before Buddhism it was used among nations.\\nIn Old Babylon and in Egypt it was to be found. What does this\\nshow? All these symbols could not have been purely\\nconventional. There must be some reason for them; some natural\\nassociation between them and the human mind. Language is not\\nthe result of convention; it is not that people ever agreed to\\nrepresent certain ideas by certain words; there never was an idea\\nwithout a corresponding word or a word without a corresponding\\nidea; ideas and words are in their nature inseparable. The symbols\\nto represent ideas may be sound symbols or colour symbols. Deaf\\nand dumb people have to think with other than sound symbols.\\nEvery thought in the mind has a form as its counterpart. This is\\ncalled in Sanskrit philosophy Nama-Rupa--name and form. It is as\\nimpossible to create by convention a system of symbols as it is to\\ncreate a language. In the world's ritualistic symbols we have an\\nexpression of the religious thought of humanity. It is easy to say\\nthat there is no use of rituals and temples and all such\\nparaphernalia; every baby says that in modern times. But it must\\nbe easy for all to see that those who worship inside a temple are in\\nmany respects different from those who will not worship there.\\nTherefore the association of particular temples, rituals, and other\\nconcrete forms with particular religions has a tendency to bring\\ninto the minds of the followers of those religions the thoughts for\\nwhich those concrete things stand as symbols; and it is not wise to\\nignore rituals and symbology altogether. The study and practice of\\nthese things form naturally a part of Karma-Yoga.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (46 of\", 'There are many other aspects of this science of work.

In every religion the\\npower of the word is recognised, so much so that in some of them\\ncreation itself is said to have come out of the word. The external\\naspect of the thought of God is the Word, and as God thought and\\nwilled before He created, creation came out of the Word. In this\\nstress and hurry of our materialistic life, our nerves lose\\nsensibility and become hardened. The older we grow, the longer\\nwe are knocked about in the world, the more callous we become;\\nand we are apt to neglect things that even happen persistently and\\nprominently around us. Human nature, however, asserts itself\\nsometimes, and we are led to inquire into and wonder at some of\\nthese common occurrences; wondering thus is the first step in the\\nacquisition of light.

It is not true that this universe is drifting and\\nstands in need of help from you and me. God is ever present\\ntherein, He is undying and eternally active and infinitely watchful.\\nWhen the whole universe sleeps, He sleeps not; He is working\\nincessantly; all the changes and manifestations of the world are\\nHis. Thirdly, we ought not to hate anyone. This world will always\\ncontinue to be a mixture of good and evil. Our duty is to\\nsympathise with the weak and to love even the wrongdoer. The\\nworld is a grand moral gymnasium wherein we have all to take\\nexercise so as to become stronger and stronger spiritually.\\nFourthly, we ought not to be fanatics of any kind, because\\nfanaticism is opposed to love. You hear fanatics glibly saying, \"I\\ndo not hate the sinner. I hate the sin,\" but I am prepared to go any\\ndistance to see the face of that man who can really make a\\ndistinction between the sin and the sinner. It is easy to say so. If\\nwe can distinguish well between quality and substance, we may\\nbecome perfect men. It is not easy to do this. And further, the\\ncalmer we are and the less disturbed our nerves, the more shall we\\nlove and the better will our work be.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (52 of', 'CHAPTER 6\\nNon-attachment is the\\ncomplete self-abnegation\\nJust as every action that emanates from us comes back to us as\\nreaction, even so our actions may act on other people and theirs\\non us. Perhaps all of you have observed it as a fact that when\\npersons do evil actions, they become more and more evil, and\\nwhen they begin to do good, they become stronger and stronger\\nand learn to do good at all times. This intensification of the\\ninfluence of action cannot be explained on any other ground than\\nthat we can act and react upon each other. To take an illustration\\nfrom physical science, when I am doing a certain action, my mind\\nmay be said to be in a certain state of vibration; all minds which\\nare in similar circumstances will have the tendency to be affected\\nby my mind. If there are different musical instruments tuned alike\\nin one room, all of you may have noticed that when one is struck,\\nthe others have the tendency to vibrate so as to give the same\\nnote. So all minds that have the same tension, so to say, will be\\nequally affected by the same thought. Of course, this influence of\\nthought on mind will vary according to distance and other causes,\\nbut the mind is always open to affection. Suppose I am doing an\\nevil act, my mind is in a certain state of vibration, and all minds in\\nthe universe, which are in a similar state, have the possibility of\\nbeing affected by the vibration of my mind. So, when I am doing\\na good action, my mind is in another state of vibration; and all\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (53 of', 'minds similarly strung have the possibility of being affected by\\nmy mind; and this power of mind upon mind is more or less\\naccording as the force of the tension is greater or less.\\nFollowing this simile further, it is quite possible that, just as light\\nwaves may travel for millions of years before they reach any\\nobject, so thought waves may also travel hundreds of years before\\nthey meet an object with which they vibrate in unison. It is quite\\npossible, therefore, that this atmosphere of ours is full of such\\nthought pulsations, both good and evil. Every thought projected\\nfrom every brain goes on pulsating, as it were, until it meets a fit\\nobject that will receive it. Any mind which is open to receive\\nsome of these impulses will take them immediately. So, when a\\nman is doing evil actions, he has brought his mind to a certain\\nstate of tension and all the waves which correspond to that state of\\ntension, and which may be said to be already in the atmosphere,\\nwill struggle to enter into his mind. That is why an evil-doer\\ngenerally goes on doing more and more evil. His actions become\\nintensified. Such, also will be the case with the doer of good; he\\nwill open himself to all the good waves that are in the atmosphere,\\nand his good actions also will become intensified. We run,\\ntherefore, a twofold danger in doing evil: first, we open ourselves\\nto all the evil influences surrounding us; secondly, we create evil\\nwhich affects others, may be hundreds of years hence. In doing\\nevil we injure ourselves and others also. In doing good we do\\ngood to ourselves and to others as well; and, like all other forces\\nin man, these forces of good and evil also gather strength from\\noutside.\\nAccording to Karma-Yoga, the action one has done cannot be\\ndestroyed until it has borne its fruit; no power in nature can stop it\\nfrom yielding its results. If I do an evil action, I must suffer for it;\\nthere is no power in this universe to stop or stay it. Similarly, if I\\ndo a good action, there is no power in the universe which can stop\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (54 of', \"its bearing good results. The cause must have its effect; nothing\\ncan prevent or restrain this. Now comes a very fine and serious\\nquestion about Karma-Yoga--namely, that these actions of ours,\\nboth good and evil, are intimately connected with each other. We\\ncannot put a line of demarcation and say, this action is entirely\\ngood and this entirely evil. There is no action which does not bear\\ngood and evil fruits at the same time. To take the nearest example:\\nI am talking to you, and some of you, perhaps, think I am doing\\ngood; and at the same time I am, perhaps, killing thousands of\\nmicrobes in the atmosphere; I am thus doing evil to something\\nelse. When it is very near to us and affects those we know, we say\\nthat it is very good action if it affects them in a good manner. For\\ninstance, you may call my speaking to you very good, but the\\nmicrobes will not; the microbes you do not see, but yourselves\\nyou do see. The way in which my talk affects you is obvious to\\nyou, but how it affects the microbes is not so obvious. And so, if\\nwe analyse our evil actions also, we may find that some good\\npossibly results from them somewhere. He who in good action\\nsees that there is something evil in it, and in the midst of evil sees\\nthat there is something good in it somewhere, has known the\\nsecret of work.\\nBut what follows from it? That, howsoever we may try, there\\ncannot be any action which is perfectly pure, or any which is\\nperfectly impure, taking purity and impurity in the sense of injury\\nand non-injury. We cannot breathe or live without injuring others,\\nand every bit of the food we eat is taken away from another's\\nmouth. Our very lives are crowding out other lives. It may be\\nmen, or animals, or small microbes, but some one or other of\\nthese we have to crowd out. That being the case, it naturally\\nfollows that perfection can never be attained by work. We may\\nwork through all eternity, but there will be no way out of this\\nintricate maze.

How can it be, seeing that\\ngood and evil are the obverse and reverse of the same coin? How\\ncan you have good without evil at the same time? What is meant\\nby perfection? A perfect life is a contradiction in terms. Life itself\\nis a state of continuous struggle between ourselves and everything\\noutside.

We have seen already that in helping the world\\nwe help ourselves. The main effect of work done for others is to\\npurify ourselves. By means of the constant effort to do good to\\nothers we are trying to forget ourselves; this forgetfulness of self\\nis the one great lesson we have to learn in life.

Here we find\\nthat Jnana, Bhakti, and Karma--all come to one point. The highest\\nideal is eternal and entire self-abnegation, where there is no \"I\",\\nbut all is \"Thou\"; and whether he is conscious or unconscious of\\nit, Karma-Yoga leads man to that end. A religious preacher may\\nbecome horrified at the idea of an Impersonal God; he may insist\\non a Personal God and wish to keep up his own identity and\\nindividuality, whatever he may mean by that. But his ideas of\\nethics, if they are really good, cannot but be based on the highest\\nself-abnegation. It is the basis of all morality; you may extend it to\\nmen, or animals, or angels, it is the one basic idea, the one\\nfundamental principle running through all ethical systems.\\nYou will find various classes of men in this world. First, there are\\nthe God-men, whose self-abnegation is complete, and who do\\nonly good to others even at the sacrifice of their own lives. These\\nare the highest of men. If there are a hundred of such in any\\ncountry, that country need never despair. But they are\\nunfortunately too few. Then there are the good men who do good\\nto others so long as it does not injure themselves. And there is a\\nthird class who, to do good to themselves, injure others. It is said\\nby a Sanskrit poet that there is a fourth unnamable class of people\\nwho injure others merely for injury\\'s sake. Just as there are at one\\npole of existence the highest good men, who do good for the sake\\nof doing good, so, at the other pole, there are others who injure\\nothers just for the sake of the injury. They do not gain anything\\nthereby, but it is their nature to do evil.\\nHere are two Sanskrit words. The one is Pravritti, which means\\nrevolving towards, and the other is Nivritti, which means\\nrevolving away. The \"revolving towards\" is what we call the\\nworld, the \"I and mine\"; it includes all those things which are\\nalways enriching that \"me\" by wealth and money and power, and\\nname and fame, and which are of a grasping nature, always\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (57 of', 'tending to accumulate everything in one centre, that centre being\\n\"myself\". That is the Pravritti, the natural tendency of every\\nhuman being; taking everything from everywhere and heaping it\\naround one centre, that centre being man\\'s own sweet self. When\\nthis tendency begins to break, when it is Nivritti or \"going away\\nfrom,\" then begin morality and religion. Both Pravritti and Nivritti\\nare of the nature of work: the former is evil work, and the latter is\\ngood work. This Nivritti is the fundamental basis of all morality\\nand all religion, and the very perfection of it is entire self-\\nabnegation, readiness to sacrifice mind and body and everything\\nfor another being. When a man has reached that state, he has\\nattained to the perfection of Karma-Yoga. This is the highest\\nresult of good works. Although a man has not studied a single\\nsystem of philosophy, although he does not believe in any God,\\nand never has believed, although he has not prayed even once in\\nhis whole life, if the simple power of good actions has brought\\nhim to that state where he is ready to give up his life and all else\\nfor others, he has arrived at the same point to which the religious\\nman will come through his prayers and the philosopher through\\nhis knowledge; and so you may find that the philosopher, the\\nworker, and the devotee, all meet at one point, that one point\\nbeing self-abnegation. However much their systems of philosophy\\nand religion may differ, all mankind stand in reverence and awe\\nbefore the man who is ready to sacrifice himself for others. Here,\\nit is not at all any question of creed, or doctrine- even men who\\nare very much opposed to all religious ideas, when they see one of\\nthese acts of complete self-sacrifice, feel that they must revere it.\\nHave you not seen even a most bigoted Christian, when he reads\\nEdwin Arnold\\'s Light of Asia, stand in reverence of Buddha, who\\npreached no God, preached nothing but self-sacrifice? The only\\nthing is that the bigot does not know that his own end and aim in\\nlife is exactly the same as that of those from whom he differs. The\\nworshipper, by keeping constantly before him the idea of God and\\na surrounding of good, comes to the same point at last and says,\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (58 of', '\"Thy will be done,\" and keeps nothing to himself. That is self-\\nabnegation. The philosopher, with his knowledge, sees that the\\nseeming self is a delusion and easily gives it up. It is self-\\nabnegation. So Karma, Bhakti, and Jnana all meet here; and this is\\nwhat was meant by all the great preachers of ancient times, when\\nthey taught that God is not the world. There is one thing which is\\nthe world and another which is God; and this distinction is very\\ntrue. What they mean by world is selfishness. Unselfishness is\\nGod. One may live on a throne, in a golden palace, and be\\nperfectly unselfish; and then he is in God. Another may live in a\\nhut and wear rags, and have nothing in the world; yet, if he is\\nselfish, he is intensely merged in the world.\\nTo come back to one of our main points, we say that we cannot do\\ngood without at the same time doing some evil, or do evil without\\ndoing some good. Knowing this, how can we work? There have,\\ntherefore, been sects in this world who have in an astoundingly\\npreposterous way preached slow suicide as the only means to get\\nout of the world, because if a man lives, he has to kill poor little\\nanimals and plants or do injury to something or some one. So\\naccording to them the only way out of the world is to die. The\\nJains have preached this doctrine as their highest ideal. This\\nteaching seems to be very logical. But the true solution is found in\\nthe Gita. It is the theory of non-attachment, to be attached to\\nnothing while doing our work of life. Know that you are separated\\nentirely from the world, though you are in the world, and that\\nwhatever you may be doing in it, you are not doing that for your\\nown sake. Any action that you do for yourself will bring its effect\\nto bear upon you. If it is a good action, you will have to take the\\ngood effect, and if bad, you will have to take the bad effect; but\\nany action that is not done for your own sake, whatever it be, will\\nhave no effect on you. There is to be found a very expressive\\nsentence in our scriptures embodying this idea: \"Even if he kill\\nthe whole universe (or be himself killed), he is neither the killer\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (59 of', 'nor the killed, when he knows that he is not acting for himself at\\nall.\" Therefore Karma-Yoga teaches, \"Do not give up the world;\\nlive in the world, imbibe its influences as much as you can; but if\\nit be for your own enjoyment\\'s sake, work not at all.\" Enjoyment\\nshould not be the goal. First kill your self and then take the whole\\nworld as yourself; as the old Christians used to say, \"The old man\\nmust die.\" This old man is the selfish idea that the whole world is\\nmade for our enjoyment. Foolish parents teach their children to\\npray, \"O Lord, Thou hast created this sun for me and this moon\\nfor me,\" as if the Lord has had nothing else to do than to create\\neverything for these babies. Do not teach your children such\\nnonsense. Then again, there are people who are foolish in another\\nway: they teach us that all these animals were created for us to kill\\nand eat, and that this universe is for the enjoyment of men. That is\\nall foolishness. A tiger may say, \"Man was created for me,\" and\\npray, \"O Lord, how wicked are these men who do not come and\\nplace themselves before me to be eaten; they are breaking Your\\nlaw.\" If the world is created for us, we are also created for the\\nworld. That this world is created for our enjoyment is the most\\nwicked idea that holds us down. This world is not for our sake.\\nMillions pass out of it every year; the world does not feel it;\\nmillions of others are supplied in their place. Just as much as the\\nworld is for us, so we also are for the world. To work properly,\\ntherefore, you have first to give up the idea of attachment.\\nSecondly, do not mix in the fray, hold yourself as a witness and\\ngo on working. My master used to say, \"Look upon your children\\nas a nurse does.\" The nurse will take your baby and fondle it and\\nplay with it and behave towards it as gently as if it were her own\\nchild; but as soon as you give her notice to quit, she is ready to\\nstart off bag and baggage from the house. Everything in the shape\\nof attachment is forgotten; it will not give the ordinary nurse the\\nleast pang to leave your children and take up other children. Even\\nso are you to be with all that you consider your own.

Vyasa\\ntaught his son wisdom; and after teaching him the knowledge of\\ntruth himself, he sent him to the court of King Janaka. He was a\\ngreat king and was called Janaka Videha. Videha means \"without\\na body\". Although a king, he had entirely forgotten that he was a\\nbody; he felt that he was a spirit all the time. This boy Shuka was\\nsent to be taught by him. The king knew that Vyasa\\'s son was\\ncoming to him to learn wisdom: so he made certain arrangements\\nbeforehand. And when the boy presented himself at the gates of\\nthe palace, the guards took no notice of him whatsoever. They\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (62 of', 'only gave him a seat, and he sat there for three days and nights,\\nnobody speaking to him, nobody asking him who he was or\\nwhence he was. He was the son of a very great sage, his father\\nwas honoured by the whole country, and he himself was a most\\nrespectable person; yet the low, vulgar guards of the palace would\\ntake no notice of him. After that, suddenly, the ministers of the\\nking and all the big officials came there and received him with the\\ngreatest honours. They conducted him in and showed him into\\nsplendid rooms, gave him the most fragrant baths and wonderful\\ndresses, and for eight days they kept him there in all kinds of\\nluxury. That solemnly serene face of Shuka did not change even\\nto the smallest extent by the change in the treatment accorded to\\nhim; he was the same in the midst of this luxury as when waiting\\nat the door. Then he was brought before the king. The king was on\\nhis throne, music was playing, and dancing and other amusements\\nwere going on. The king then gave him a cup of milk, full to the\\nbrim, and asked him to go seven times round the hall without\\nspilling even a drop. The boy took the cup and proceeded in the\\nmidst of the music and the attraction of the beautiful faces. As\\ndesired by the king, seven times did he go round, and not a drop\\nof the milk was spilt. The boy\\'s mind could not be attracted by\\nanything in the world, unless he allowed it to affect him. And\\nwhen he brought the cup to the king, the king said to him, \"What\\nyour father has taught you, and what you have learned yourself, I\\ncan only repeat. You have known the Truth; go home.\"\\nThus the man that has practised control over himself cannot be\\nacted upon by anything outside; there is no more slavery for him.\\nHis mind has become free. Such a man alone is fit to live well in\\nthe world. We generally find men holding two opinions regarding\\nthe world. Some are pessimists and say, \"How horrible this world\\nis, how wicked!\" Some others are optimists and say, \"How\\nbeautiful this world is, how wonderful!\" To those who have not\\ncontrolled their own minds, the world is either full of evil or at\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (63 of', 'best a mixture of good and evil. This very world will become to\\nus an optimistic world when we become masters of our own\\nminds. Nothing will then work upon us as good or evil; we shall\\nfind everything to be in its proper place, to be harmonious. Some\\nmen, who begin by saying that the world is a hell, often end by\\nsaying that it is a heaven when they succeed in the practice of self-\\ncontrol. If we are genuine Karma Yogis and wish to train\\nourselves to that attainment of this state, wherever we may begin\\nwe are sure to end in perfect self-abnegation; and as soon as this\\nseeming self has gone, the whole world, which at first appears to\\nus to be filled with evil, will appear to be heaven itself and full of\\nblessedness. Its very atmosphere will be blessed; every human\\nface there will be god. Such is the end and aim of Karma-Yoga,\\nand such is its perfection in practical life. Our various Yogas do\\nnot conflict with each other; each of them leads us to the same\\ngoal and makes us perfect. Only each has to be strenuously\\npractised. The whole secret is in practising. First you have to hear,\\nthen think, and then practise. This is true of every Yoga. You have\\nfirst to hear about it and understand what it is; and many things\\nwhich you do not understand will be made clear to you by\\nconstant hearing and thinking. It is hard to understand everything\\nat once. The explanation of everything is after all in yourself. No\\none was ever really taught by another; each of us has to teach\\nhimself. The external teacher offers only the suggestion which\\nrouses the internal teacher to work to understand things. Then\\nthings will be made clearer to us by our own power of perception\\nand thought, and we shall realise them in our own souls; and that\\nrealisation will grow into the intense power of will. First it is\\nfeeling, then it becomes willing, and out of that willing comes the\\ntremendous force for work that will go through every vein and\\nnerve and muscle, until the whole mass of your body is changed\\ninto an instrument of the unselfish Yoga of work, and the desired\\nresult of perfect self-abnegation and utter unselfishness is duly\\nattained. This attainment does not depend on any dogma, or\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (64 of', 'doctrine, or belief. Whether one is Christian, or Jew, or Gentile, it\\ndoes not matter. Are you unselfish? That is the question. If you\\nare, you will be perfect without reading a single religious book,\\nwithout going into a single church or temple. Each one of our\\nYogas is fitted to make man perfect even without the help of the\\nothers, because they have all the same goal in view. The Yogas of\\nwork, of wisdom, and of devotion are all capable of serving as\\ndirect and independent means for the attainment of Moksha.\\n\"Fools alone say that work and philosophy are different, not the\\nlearned.\" The learned know that, though apparently different from\\neach other, they at last lead to the same goal of human perfection.\\nCHAPTER 7\\nFreedom\\nIn addition to meaning work, we have stated that psychologically\\nthe word Karma also implies causation. Any work, any action, any\\nthought that produces an effect is called a Karma. Thus the law of\\nKarma means the law of causation, of inevitable cause and\\nsequence. Wheresoever there is a cause, there an effect must be\\nproduced; this necessity cannot be resisted, and this law of Karma,\\naccording to our philosophy, is true throughout the whole\\nuniverse. Whatever we see, or feel, or do, whatever action there is\\nanywhere in the universe, while being the effect of past work on\\nthe one hand, becomes, on the other, a cause in its turn, and\\nproduces its own effect. It is necessary, together with this, to\\nconsider what is meant by the word \"law\". By law is meant the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (65 of', 'tendency of a series to repeat itself. When we see one event\\nfollowed by another, or sometimes happening simultaneously with\\nanother, we expect this sequence or co-existence to recur. Our old\\nlogicians and philosophers of the Nyaya school call this law by the\\nname of Vyapti. According to them, all our ideas of law are due to\\nassociation. A series of phenomena becomes associated with\\nthings in our mind in a sort of invariable order, so that whatever\\nwe perceive at any time is immediately referred to other facts in\\nthe mind. Any one idea or, according to our psychology, any one\\nwave that is produced in the mind-stuff, Chitta, must always give\\nrise to many similar waves. This is the psychological idea of\\nassociation, and causation is only as aspect of this grand pervasive\\nprinciple of association. This pervasiveness of association is what\\nis, in Sanskrit, called Vyapti. In the external world the idea of law\\nis the same as in the internal--the expectation that a particular\\nphenomenon will be followed by another, and that the series will\\nrepeat itself. Really speaking, therefore, law does not exist in\\nnature. Practically it is an error to say that gravitation exists in the\\nearth, or that there is any law existing objectively anywhere in\\nnature. Law is the method, the manner in which our mind grasps a\\nseries of phenomena; it is all in the mind. Certain phenomena,\\nhappening one after another or together, and followed by the\\nconviction of the regularity of their recurrence--thus enabling our\\nminds to grasp the method of the whole series--constitute what we\\ncall law.\\nThe next question for consideration is what we mean by law being\\nuniversal. Our universe is that portion of existence which is\\ncharacterised by what the Sanskrit psychologists call Desha-kala-\\nnimitta, or what is known to European psychology as space, time,\\nand causation. This universe is only a part of infinite existence,\\nthrown into a peculiar mould, composed of space, time, and\\ncausation. It necessarily follows that law is possible only within\\nthis conditioned universe; beyond it there cannot be any law.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (66 of', 'When we speak of the universe, we only mean that portion of\\nexistence which is limited by our mind--the universe of the senses,\\nwhich we can see, feel, touch, hear, think of, imagine. This alone\\nis under law; but beyond it existence cannot be subject to law,\\nbecause causation does not extend beyond the world of our minds.\\nAnything beyond the range of our mind and our senses is not\\nbound by the law of causation, as there is no mental association of\\nthings in the region beyond the senses, and no causation without\\nassociation of ideas. It is only when \"being\" or existence gets\\nmoulded into name and form that it obeys the law of causation,\\nand is said to be under law; because all law has its essence in\\ncausation. Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such\\nthing as free will; the very words are a contradiction, because will\\nis what we know and everything that we know is within our\\nuniverse, and everything within our universe is mouled by the\\nconditions of space, time, and causation. Everything that we\\nknow, or can possibly know, must be subject to causation, and that\\nwhich obeys the law of causation cannot be free. It is acted upon\\nby other agents, and becomes a cause in its turn. But that which\\nhas become converted into the will, which was not the will before,\\nbut which, when it fell into this mould of space, time, and\\ncausation, became converted into the human will, is free; and\\nwhen this will gets out of this mould of space,time, and causation,\\nit will be free again. From freedom it comes, and becomes\\nmoulded into this bondage, and it gets out and goes back to\\nfreedom again.\\nThe question has been raised as to from whom this universe\\ncomes, in whom it rests, and to whom it goes; and the answer has\\nbeen given that from freedom it comes, in bondage it rests, and\\ngoes back into that freedom again. So, when we speak of man as\\nno other than that infinite being which is manifesting itself, we\\nmean that only one very small part thereof is man; this body and\\nthis mind which we see are only one part of the whole, only one\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (67 of', 'spot of the infinite being. This whole universe is only one speck of\\nthe infinite being; and all our laws, our bondages, our joys and our\\nsorrows, our happinesses and our expectations, are only within\\nthis small universe; all our progression and digression are within\\nits small compass. So you see how childish it is to expect a\\ncontinuation of this universe--the creation of our minds--and to\\nexpect to go to heaven, which after all must mean only a repetition\\nof this world that we know. You see at once that it is an\\nimpossible and childish desire to make the whole of infinite\\nexistence conform to the limited and conditioned existence which\\nwe know. When a man says that he will have again and again this\\nsame thing which he is having now, or, as I sometimes put it,\\nwhen he asks for a comfortable religion, you may know that he\\nhas become so degenerate that he cannot think of anything higher\\nthan what he is now; he is just his little present surroundings and\\nnothing more. He has forgotten his infinite nature, and his whole\\nidea is confined to these little joys, and sorrows, and heart-\\njealousies of the moment. He thinks that this finite thing is the\\ninfinite; and not only so, he will not let this foolishness go. He\\nclings on desperately unto Trishna, and the thirst after life, what\\nthe Buddhists call Tanha and Tissa. There may be millions of\\nkinds of happiness, and beings, and laws, and progress, and\\ncausation, all acting outside the little universe that we know; and,\\nafter all, the whole of this comprises but one section of our infinite\\nnature.\\nTo acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this\\nuniverse; it cannot be found here. Perfect equilibrium, or what the\\nChristians call the peace that passeth all understanding, cannot be\\nhad in this universe, nor in heaven, nor in any place where our\\nmind and thoughts can go, where the senses can feel, or which the\\nimagination can conceive. No such place can give us that freedom,\\nbecause all such places would be within our universe, and it is\\nlimited by space, time, and causation. There may be places that\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (68 of', 'are more ethereal than this earth of ours, where enjoyments may\\nbe keener, but even those places must be in the universe and,\\ntherefore, in bondage to law; so we have to go beyond, and real\\nreligion begins where this little universe ends. These little joys,\\nand sorrows, and knowledge of things end there, and the reality\\nbegins. Until we give up the thirst after life, the strong attachment\\nto this our transient conditioned existence, we have no hope of\\ncatching even a glimpse of that infinite freedom beyond. It stands\\nto reason then that there is only one way to attain to that freedom\\nwhich is the goal of all the noblest aspirations of mankind, and\\nthat is by giving up this little life, giving up this little universe,\\ngiving up this earth, giving up heaven, giving up the body, giving\\nup the mind, giving up everything that is limited and conditioned.\\nIf we give up our attachment to this little universe of the senses or\\nof the mind, we shall be free immediately. The only way to come\\nout of bondage is to go beyond the limitations of law, to go\\nbeyond causation.\\nBut it is a most difficult thing to give up the clinging to this\\nuniverse; few ever attain to that. There are two ways to do that\\nmentioned in our books. One is called the \"Neti, Neti\" (not this,\\nnot this), the other is called \"iti\" (this); the former is the negative,\\nand the latter is the positive way. The negative way is the most\\ndifficult. It is only possible to the men of the very highest,\\nexceptional minds and gigantic wills who simply stand up and say,\\n\"No, I will not have this,\" and the mind and body obey their will,\\nand they come out successful. But such people are very rare. The\\nvast majority of mankind choose the positive way, the way\\nthrough the world, making use of all the bondages themselves to\\nbreak those very bondages. This is also a kind of giving up; only it\\nis done slowly and gradually, by knowing things, enjoying things\\nand thus obtaining experience, and knowing the nature of things\\nuntil the mind lets them all go at last and becomes unattached. The\\nformer way of obtaining non-attachment is by reasoning, and the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (69 of', 'latter way is through work and experience. The first is the path of\\nJnana-Yoga and is characterised by the refusal to do any work; the\\nsecond is that of Karma-Yoga, in which there is no cessation from\\nwork. Every one must work in the universe. Only those who are\\nperfectly satisfied with the Self, whose desires do not go beyond\\nthe Self, whose mind never strays out of the Self, to whom the\\nSelf is all in all, only those do not work. The rest must work. A\\ncurrent rushing down of its own nature falls into a hollow and\\nmakes a whirlpool, and, after running a little in that whirlpool, it\\nemerges again in the form of the free current to go on unchecked.\\nEach human life is like that current. It gets into the whirl, gets\\ninvolved in this world of space, time, and causation, whirls round\\na little, crying out, \"my father, my brother, my name, my fame,\"\\nand so on, and at last emerges out of it and regains its original\\nfreedom. The whole universe is doing that. Whether we know it or\\nnot, whether we are conscious or unconscious of it, we are all\\nworking to get out of the dream of the world. Man\\'s experience in\\nthe world is to enable him to get out of its whirlpool.\\nWhat is Karma-Yoga? The knowledge of the secret of work. We\\nsee that the whole universe is working. For what? For salvation,\\nfor liberty; from the atom to the highest being, working for the one\\nend, liberty for the mind, for the body, for the spirit. All things are\\nalways trying to get freedom, flying away from bondage. The sun,\\nthe moon, the earth, the planets, all are trying to fly away from\\nbondage. The centrifugal and the centripetal forces of nature are\\nindeed typical of our universe. Instead of being knocked about in\\nthis universe, and after long delay and thrashing, getting to know\\nthings as they are, we learn from Karma-Yoga the secret of work,\\nthe method of work, the organising power of work. A vast mass of\\nenergy may be spent in vain if we do not know how to utilise it.\\nKarma- Yoga makes a science of work; you learn by it how best to\\nutilise all the workings of this world. Work is inevitable, it must\\nbe so; but we should work to the highest purpose.

There are no doubt\\nthese exceptional beings; but the rest of mankind have to go\\nslowing through the world of work. Karma-Yoga shows the\\nprocess, the secret, and the method of doing it to the best\\nadvantage.\\nWhat does it say? \"Work incessantly, but give up all attachment to\\nwork.\" Do not identify yourself with anything. Hold your mind\\nfree. All this that you see, the pains and the miseries, are but the\\nnecessary conditions of this world; poverty and wealth and\\nhappiness are but momentary; they do not belong to our real\\nnature at all. Our nature is far beyond misery and happiness,\\nbeyond every object of the senses, beyond the imagination; and\\nyet we must go on working all the time. \"Misery comes through\\nattachment, not through work.\" As soon as we identify ourselves\\nwith the work we do, we feel miserable; but if we do not identify\\nourselves with it, we do not feel that misery. If a beautiful picture\\nbelonging to another is burnt, a man does not generally become\\nmiserable; but when his own picture is burnt, how miserable he\\nfeels! Why? Both were beautiful pictures, perhaps copies of the\\nsame original; but in one case very much more misery is felt than\\nin the other. It is because in one case he identifies himself with the\\npicture, and not in the other. This \"I and mine\" causes the whole\\nmisery. With the sense of possession comes selfishness, and\\nselfishness brings on misery. Every act of selfishness or thought of\\nselfishness makes us attached to something, and immediately we\\nare made slaves. Each wave in the Chitta that says \"I and mine\"\\nimmediately puts a chain round us and makes us slaves; and the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (71 of', 'more we say \"I and mine\", the more slavery grows, the more\\nmisery increases. Therefore Karma-Yoga tells us to enjoy the\\nbeauty of all the pictures in the world, but not to identify ourselves\\nwith any of them. Never say \"mine\". Whenever we say a thing is\\n\"mine\", misery will immediately come. Do not even say \"my\\nchild\" in your mind. Possess the child, but do not say \"mine\". If\\nyou do, then will come the misery. Do not\\nsay \"my house,\" do not say \"my body\". The whole difficulty is\\nthere. The body is neither yours, nor mine, nor anybody\\'s. These\\nbodies are coming and going by the laws of nature, but we are\\nfree, standing as witness. This body is no more free than a picture\\nor a wall. Why should we be attached so much to a body? If\\nsomebody paints a picture, he does it and passes on. Do not\\nproject that tentacle of selfishness, \"I must possess it\". As soon as\\nthat is projected, misery will begin.\\nSo Karma-Yoga says, first destroy the tendency to project this\\ntentacle of selfishness, and when you have the power of checking\\nit, hold it in and do not allow the mind to get into the ways of\\nselfishness. Then you may go out into the world and work as\\nmuch as you can. Mix everywhere, go where you please; you will\\nnever be contaminated with evil. There is the lotus leaf in the\\nwater; the water cannot touch and adhere to it; so will you be in\\nthe world. This is called \"Vairagya\", dispassion or non-\\nattachment. I believe I have told you that without non-attachment\\nthere cannot be any kind of Yoga. Non-attachment is the basis of\\nall the Yogas. The man who gives up living in houses, wearing\\nfine clothes, and eating good food, and goes into the desert, may\\nbe a most attached person. His only possession, his own body,\\nmay become everything to him; and as he lives he will be simply\\nstruggling for the sake of his body. Non-attachment does not mean\\nanything that we may do in relation to our external body, it is all\\nin the mind. The binding link of \"I and mine\" is in the mind. If we\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (72 of', 'have not this link with the body and with the things of the senses,\\nwe are non-attached, wherever and whatever we may be. A man\\nmay be on a throne and perfectly non-attached; another man may\\nbe in rags and still very much attached. First, we have to attain this\\nstate of non-attachment and then to work incessantly. Karma-\\nYoga gives us the method that will help us in giving up all\\nattachment, though it is indeed very hard.\\nHere are the two ways of giving up all attachment. The one is for\\nthose who do not believe in God, or in any outside help. They are\\nleft to their own devices; they have simply to work with their own\\nwill, with the powers of their mind and discrimination, saying, \"I\\nmust be non-attached\". For those who believe in God there is\\nanother way, which is much less difficult. They give up the fruits\\nof work unto the Lord; they work and are never attached to the\\nresults. Whatever they see, feel, hear, or do, is for Him. For\\nwhatever good work we may do, let us not claim any praise or\\nbenefit. It is the Lord\\'s; give up the fruits unto Him. Let us stand\\naside and think that we are only servants obeying the Lord, our\\nMaster, and that every impulse for action comes from Him every\\nmoment. Whatever thou worshippest, whatever thou perceivest,\\nwhatever thou doest, give up all unto Him and be at rest. Let us be\\nat peace, perfect peace, with ourselves, and give up our whole\\nbody and mind and everything as an eternal sacrifice unto the\\nLord. Instead of the sacrifice of pouring oblations into the fire,\\nperform this one great sacrifice day and night--the sacrifice of\\nyour little self. \"In search of wealth in this world, Thou art the\\nonly wealth I have found; I sacrifice myself unto Thee. In search\\nof some one to be loved, Thou art the only one beloved I have\\nfound; I sacrifice myself unto Thee.\" Let us repeat this day and\\nnight, and say, \"Nothing for me; no matter whether the thing is\\ngood, bad, or indifferent; I do not care for it; I sacrifice all unto\\nThee.\" Day and night let us renounce our seeming self until it\\nbecomes a habit with us to do so, until it gets into the blood, the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (73 of', 'nerves, and the brain, and the whole body is every moment\\nobedient to this idea of self-renunciation.

Yet we\\nmay see that this peculiar sense of duty is very often a great cause\\nof misery. Duty becomes a disease with us; it drags us ever\\nforward. It catches hold of us and makes our whole life miserable.\\nIt is the bane of human life. This duty, this idea of duty is the\\nmidday summer sun which scorches the innermost soul of\\nmankind.

This is duty as it is understood. The only true duty is to be\\nunattached and to work as free beings, to give up all work unto\\nGod. All our duties are His. Blessed are we that we are ordered\\nout here. We serve our time; whether we do it ill or well, who\\nknows? If we do it well, we do not get the fruits. If we do it ill,\\nneither do we get the care. Be at rest, be free, and work. This kind\\nof freedom is a very hard thing to attain. How easy it is to interpret\\nslavery as duty--the morbid attachment of flesh for flesh as duty!\\nMen go out into the world and struggle and fight for money or for\\nany other thing to which they get attached. Ask them why they do\\nit. They say, \"It is a duty.\" It is the absurd greed for gold and gain,\\nand they try to cover it with a few flowers.\\nWhat is duty after all? It is really the impulsion of the flesh, of our\\nattachment; and when an attachment has become established, we\\ncall it duty. For instance, in countries where there is no marriage,\\nthere is no duty between husband and wife; when marriage comes,\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (74 of', \"husband and wife live together on account of attachment; and that\\nkind of living together becomes settled after generations; and\\nwhen it becomes so settled, it becomes a duty.

He\\ndoes not show himself to men, and yet he is a magazine of love\\nand of true and sweet ideas.\\nNext in order come the men with more Rajas, or activity,\\ncombative natures, who take up the ideas of the perfect ones and\\npreach them to the world. The highest kind of men silently collect\\ntrue and noble ideas, and others--the Buddhas and Christs--go\\nfrom place to place preaching them and working for them. In the\\nlife of Gautama Buddha we notice him constantly saying that he is\\nthe twenty-fifth Buddha. The twenty-four before him are unknown\\nto history, although the Buddha known to history must have built\\nupon foundations laid by them. The highest men are calm, silent,\\nand unknown. They are the men who really know the power of\\nthought; they are sure that, even if they go into a cave and close\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (76 of\", 'the door and simply think five true thoughts and then pass away,\\nthese five thoughts of theirs will live through eternity. Indeed such\\nthoughts will penetrate through the mountains, cross the oceans,\\nand travel through the world. They will enter deep into human\\nhearts and brains and raise up men and women who will give them\\npractical expression in the workings of human life. These Sattvika\\nmen are too near the Lord to be active and to fight, to be working,\\nstruggling, preaching, and doing good, as they say, here on earth\\nto humanity. The active workers, however good, have still a little\\nremnant of ignorance left in them. When our nature has yet some\\nimpurities left in it, then alone can we work. It is in the nature of\\nwork to be impelled ordinarily by motive and by attachment. In\\nthe presence of an ever active Providence who notes even the\\nsparrow\\'s fall, how can man attach any importance to his own\\nwork? Will it not be a blasphemy to do so when we know that He\\nis taking care of the minutest things in the world? We have only to\\nstand in awe and reverence before Him saying, \"Thy will be\\ndone\". The highest men cannot work, for in them there is no\\nattachment. Those whose whole soul is gone into the Self, those\\nwhose desires are confined in the Self, who have become ever\\nassociated with the Self, for them there is no work. Such are\\nindeed the highest of mankind; but apart from them every one else\\nhas to work. In so working we should never think that we can help\\non even the least thing in this universe. We cannot. We only help\\nourselves in this gymnasium of the world. This is the proper\\nattitude of work. If we work in this way, if we always remember\\nthat our present opportunity to work thus is a privilege which has\\nbeen given to us, we shall never be attached to anything.\\nMillions like you and me think that we are great people in the\\nworld; but we all die, and in five minutes the world forgets us. But\\nthe life of God is infinite. \"Who can live a moment, breathe a\\nmoment, if this all-powerful One does not will it?\" He is the ever\\nactive Providence. All power is His and within His command.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (77 of', 'Through His command the winds blow, the sun shines, the earth\\nlives, and death stalks upon the earth.

These\\ndivisions are made in accordance with the type or the tendency\\nthat may be seen to prevail in a man. We have found that, in the\\nend, all these four paths converge and become one. All religions\\nand all methods of work and worship lead us to one and the same\\ngoal. I have already tried to point out that goal. It is freedom as I\\nunderstand it. Everything that we perceive around us is struggling\\ntowards freedom, from the atom to the man, from the insentient,\\nlifeless particle of matter to the highest existence on earth, the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (78 of', 'human soul. The whole universe is in fact the result of this\\nstruggle for freedom. In all combinations every particle is trying to\\ngo on its own way, to fly from the other particles; but the others\\nare holding it in check. Our earth is trying to fly away from the\\nsun, and the moon from the earth. Everything has a tendency to\\ninfinite dispersion. All that we see in the universe has for its basis\\nthis one struggle towards freedom; it is under the impulse of this\\ntendency that the saint prays and the robber robs. When the line of\\naction taken is not a proper one, we call it evil; and when the\\nmanifestation of it is proper and high, we call it good. But the\\nimpulse is the same, the struggle towards freedom. The saint is\\noppressed with the knowledge of his condition of bondage, and he\\nwants to get rid of it; so he worships God. The thief is oppressed\\nwith the idea that he does not possess certain things, and he tries\\nto get rid of that want, to obtain freedom from it; so he steals.\\nFreedom is the one goal of all nature, sentient or insentient; and\\nconsciously or unconsciously, everything is struggling towards\\nthat goal. The freedom which the saint seeks is very different from\\nthat which the robber seeks; the freedom loved by the saint leads\\nhim to the enjoyment of infinite, unspeakable bliss, while that on\\nwhich the robber has set his heart only forges other bonds for his\\nsoul.\\nThere is to be found in every religion the manifestation of this\\nstruggle towards freedom. It is the groundwork of all morality, of\\nunselfishness, which means getting rid of the idea that men are the\\nsame as their little body. When we see a man doing good work,\\nhelping others, it means that he cannot be confined within the\\nlimited circle of \"me and mine\". There is no limit to this getting\\nout of selfishness. All the great systems of ethics preach absolute\\nunselfishness as the goal. Supposing this absolute unselfishness\\ncan be reached by a man, what becomes of him? He is no more the\\nlittle Mr. So-and-so; he has acquired infinite expansion. The little\\npersonality which he had before is now lost to him for ever; he has\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (79 of', 'become infinite, and the attainment of this infinite expansion is\\nindeed the goal of all religions and of all moral and philosophical\\nteachings. The personalist, when he hears this idea philosophically\\nput, gets frightened. At the same time, if he preaches morality, he\\nafter all teaches the very same idea himself. He puts no limit to the\\nunselfishness of man. Suppose a man becomes perfectly unselfish\\nunder the personalistic system, how are we to distinguish him\\nfrom the perfected ones in other systems? He has become one with\\nthe universe and to become that is the goal of all; only the poor\\npersonalist has not the courage to follow out his own reasoning to\\nits right conclusion. Karma-Yoga is the attaining through unselfish\\nwork of that freedom which is the goal of all human nature. Every\\nselfish action, therefore, retards our reaching the goal, and every\\nunselfish action takes us towards the goal; that is why the only\\ndefinition that can be given of morality is this: That which is\\nselfish is immoral, and that which is unselfish is moral.\\nBut, if you come to details, the matter will not be seen to be quite\\nso simple. For instance, environment often makes the details\\ndifferent as I have already mentioned. The same action under one\\nset of circumstances may be unselfish, and under another set quite\\nselfish. So we can give only a general definition, and leave the\\ndetails to be worked out by taking into consideration the\\ndifferences in time, place, and circumstances. In one country one\\nkind of conduct is considered moral, and in another the very same\\nis immoral, because the circumstances differ. The goal of all\\nnature is freedom, and freedom is to be attained only by perfect\\nunselfishness; every thought, word, or deed that is unselfish takes\\nus towards the goal, and, as such, is called moral. That definition,\\nyou will find, holds good in every religion and every system of\\nethics. In some systems of thought morality is derived from a\\nSuperior Being--God. If you ask why a man ought to do this and\\nnot that, their answer is : \"Because such is the command of God.\"\\nBut whatever be the source from which it is derived, their code of\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (80 of', 'ethics also has the same central idea--not to think of self but to\\ngive up self. And yet some persons, in spite of this high ethical\\nidea, are frightened at the thought of having to give up their little\\npersonalities. We may ask the man who clings to the idea of little\\npersonalities to consider the case of a person who has become\\nperfectly unselfish, who has no thought for himself, who does no\\ndeed for himself, who speaks no word for himself, and then say\\nwhere his \"himself\" is. That \"himself\" is known to him only so\\nlong as he thinks, acts, or speaks for himself. If he is only\\nconscious of others, of the universe, and of the all, where is his\\n\"himself\"? It is gone forever.\\nKarma-Yoga, therefore, is a system of ethics and religion intended\\nto attain freedom through unselfishness, and by good works. The\\nKarma-Yogi need not believe in any doctrine whatever. He may\\nnot believe even in God, may not ask what his soul is, nor think of\\nany metaphysical speculation. He has got his own special aim of\\nrealising selflessness; and he has to work it out himself. Every\\nmoment of his life must be realisation, because he has to solve by\\nmere work, without the help of doctrine or theory, the very same\\nproblem to which the Jnani applies his reason and inspiration and\\nthe Bhakta his love.\\nNow comes the next question: What is this work? What is this\\ndoing good to the world? Can we do good to the world? In an\\nabsolute sense, no; in a relative sense, yes. No permanent or\\neverlasting good can be done to the world; if it could be done, the\\nworld would not be this world. We may satisfy the hunger of a\\nman for five minutes, but he will be hungry again. Every pleasure\\nwith which we supply a man may be seen to be momentary. No\\none can permanently cure this ever-recurring fever of pleasure and\\npain. Can any permanent happiness be given to the world? In the\\nocean we cannot raise a wave without causing a hollow\\nsomewhere else. The sum total of the good things in the world has\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (81 of', \"been the same throughout in its relation to man's need and greed.\\nIt cannot be increased or decreased. Take the history of the human\\nrace as we know it today. Do we not find the same miseries and\\nthe same happiness, the same pleasures and pains, the same\\ndifferences in position? Are not some rich, some poor, some high,\\nsome low, some healthy, some unhealthy? All this was just the\\nsame with the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans in ancient\\ntimes as it is with the Americans today. So far as history is known,\\nit has always been the same; yet at the same time we find that,\\nrunning along with all these incurable differences of pleasure and\\npain, there has ever been the struggle to alleviate them. Every\\nperiod of history has given birth to thousands of men and women\\nwho have worked hard to smooth the passage of life for others.\\nAnd how far have they succeeded? We can only play at driving\\nthe ball from one place to another. We take away pain from the\\nphysical plane, and it goes to the mental one. It is like that picture\\nin Dante's hell where the misers were given a mass of gold to roll\\nup a hill. Every time they rolled it up a little, it again rolled down.\\nAll our talks about the millennium are very nice as school-boys'\\nstories, but they are no better than that. All nations that dream of\\nthe millennium also think that, of all peoples in the world, they\\nwill have the best of it then for themselves. This is the\\nwonderfully unselfish idea of the millennium!\\nWe cannot add happiness to this world; similarly, we cannot add\\npain to it either. The sum total of the energies of pleasure and pain\\ndisplayed here on earth will be the same throughout. We just push\\nit from this side to the other side, and from that side to this, but it\\nwill remain the same, because to remain so is its very nature. This\\nebb and flow, this rising and falling, is in the world's very nature;\\nit would be as logical to hold otherwise as to say that we may have\\nlife without death. This is complete nonsense, because the very\\nidea of life implies death and the very idea of pleasure implies\\npain. The lamp is constantly burning out, and that is its life.

Life and\\ndeath are only different expressions of the same thing looked at\\nfrom different standpoints; they are the falling and the rising of the\\nsame wave, and the two form one whole. One looks at the \"fall\"\\nside and becomes a pessimist, another looks at the \"rise\" side and\\nbecomes an optimist. When a boy is going to school and his father\\nand mother are taking care of him, everything seems blessed to\\nhim; his wants are simple, he is a great optimist. But the old man,\\nwith his varied experience, becomes calmer, and is sure to have\\nhis warmth considerably cooled down. So, old nations, with signs\\nof decay all around them, are apt to be less hopeful than new\\nnations. There is a proverb in India: \"A thousand years a city, and\\na thousand years a forest.\" This change of city into forest and vice\\nversa is going on everywhere, and it makes people optimists or\\npessimists according to the side they see of it.\\nThe next idea we take up is the idea of equality. These millennium\\nideas have been great motive powers to work. Many religions\\npreach this an an element in them--that God is coming to rule the\\nuniverse, and that then there will be no difference at all in\\nconditions. The people who preach this doctrine are mere fanatics,\\nand fanatics are indeed the sincerest of mankind. Christianity was\\npreached just on the basis of the fascination of this fanaticism, and\\nthat is what made it so attractive to the Greek and the Roman\\nslaves. They believed that under the millennial religion there\\nwould be no more slavery, that there would be plenty to eat and\\ndrink; and, therefore, they flocked round the Christian standard.\\nThose who preached the idea first were of course ignorant\\nfanatics, but very sincere. In modern times this millennial\\naspiration takes the form of equality--of liberty, equality, and\\nfraternity. This is also fanaticism. True equality has never been\\nand never can be on earth. How can we all be equal here? This\\nimpossible kind of equality implies total death. What makes this\\nworld what it is? Lost balance. In the primal state, which is called\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (83 of', 'chaos, there is perfect balance. How do all the formative forces of\\nthe universe come then? By struggling, competition, conflict.\\nSuppose that all the particles of matter were held in equilibrium,\\nwould there be then any process of creation? We know from\\nscience that it is impossible. Disturb a sheet of water, and there\\nyou find every particle of the water trying to become calm again,\\none rushing against the other; and in the same way all the\\nphenomena which we call the universe--all things therein--are\\nstruggling to get back to the state of perfect balance. Again a\\ndisturbance comes, and again we have combination and creation.\\nInequality is the very basis of creation. At the same time the forces\\nstruggling to obtain equality are as much a necessity of creation as\\nthose which destroy it.\\nAbsolute equality, that which means a perfect balance of all the\\nstruggling forces in all the planes, can never be in this world.\\nBefore you attain that state, the world will have become quite\\nunfit for any kind of life, and no one will be there. We find,\\ntherefore, that all these ideas of the millennium and of absolute\\nequality are not only impossible but also that, if we try to carry\\nthem out, they will lead us surely enough to the day of destruction.\\nWhat makes the difference between man and man? It is largely the\\ndifference in the brain. Nowadays no one but a lunatic will say\\nthat we are all born with the same brain power. We come into the\\nworld with unequal endowments; we come as greater men or as\\nlesser men, and there is no getting away from that pre-natally\\ndetermined condition. The American Indians were in this country\\nfor thousands of years, and a few handfuls of your ancestors came\\nto their land. What difference they have caused in the appearance\\nof the country! Why did not the Indians make improvements and\\nbuild cities, if all were equal? With your ancestors a different sort\\nof brain power came into the land, different bundles of past\\nimpressions came, and they worked out and manifested\\nthemselves. Absolute non-differentiation is death. So long as this\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (84 of', \"world lasts, differentiation there will and must be, and the\\nmillennium of perfect equality will come only when a cycle of\\ncreation comes to its end. Before that, equality cannot be. Yet this\\nidea of realising the millennium is a great motive power. Just as\\ninequality is necessary for creation itself, so the struggle to limit it\\nis also necessary. If there were no struggle to become free and get\\nback to God, there would be no creation either. It is the difference\\nbetween these two forces that determines the nature of the motives\\nof men. There will always be these motives to work, some tending\\ntowards bondage and others towards freedom.\\nThis world's wheel within wheel is a terrible mechanism; if we put\\nour hands in it, as soon as we are caught we are gone. We all think\\nthat when we have done a certain duty, we shall be at rest; but\\nbefore we have done a part of that duty, another is already in\\nwaiting. We are all being dragged along by this mighty, complex\\nworld-machine. There are only two ways out of it; one is to give\\nup all concerns with the machine, to let it go and stand aside, to\\ngive up our desires. That is very easy to say, but is almost\\nimpossible to do. I do not know whether in twenty millions of men\\none can do that. The other way is to plunge into the world and\\nlearn the secret of work, and that is the way of Karma-Yoga.

Through this machinery\\nitself is the way out.\\nWe have now seen what work is. It is a part of nature's foundation,\\nand goes on always.

The Karma Yogi asks why you require any\\nmotive to work other than the inborn love of freedom. Be beyond\\nthe common worldly motives. \"To work you have the right, but\\nnot to the fruits thereof.\" Man can train himself to know and to\\npractise that, says the Karma Yogi. When the idea of doing good\\nbecomes a part of his very being, then he will not seek for any\\nmotive outside. Let us do good because it is good to do good; he\\nwho does good work even in order to get to heaven binds himself\\ndown, says the Karma Yogi. Any work that is done with any the\\nleast selfish motive, instead of making us free, forges one more\\nchain for our feet.\\nSo the only way is to give up all the fruits of work, to be\\nunattached to them. Know that this world is not we, nor are we\\nthis world; that we are really not the body; that we really do not\\nwork. We are the Self, eternally at rest and at peace. Why should\\nwe be bound by anything? It is very good to say that we should be\\nperfectly non-attached, but what is the way to do it? Every good\\nwork we do without any ulterior motive, instead of forging a new\\nchain, will break one of the links in the existing chains. Every\\ngood thought that we send to the world without thinking of any\\nreturn, will be stored up there and break one link in the chain, and\\nmake us purer and purer, until we become the purest of mortals.\\nYet all this may seem to be rather quixotic and too philosophical,\\nmore theoretical than practical.

But Buddha is the only prophet who said, \"I do\\nnot care to know your various theories about God. What is the use\\nof discussing all the subtle doctrines about the soul? Do good and\\nbe good.

The whole universe is in fact the result of this\\nstruggle for freedom. In all combinations every particle is trying to\\ngo on its own way, to fly from the other particles; but the others\\nare holding it in check. Our earth is trying to fly away from the\\nsun, and the moon from the earth. Everything has a tendency to\\ninfinite dispersion. All that we see in the universe has for its basis\\nthis one struggle towards freedom; it is under the impulse of this\\ntendency that the saint prays and the robber robs. When the line of\\naction taken is not a proper one, we call it evil; and when the\\nmanifestation of it is proper and high, we call it good. But the\\nimpulse is the same, the struggle towards freedom. The saint is\\noppressed with the knowledge of his condition of bondage, and he\\nwants to get rid of it; so he worships God. The thief is oppressed\\nwith the idea that he does not possess certain things, and he tries\\nto get rid of that want, to obtain freedom from it; so he steals.\\nFreedom is the one goal of all nature, sentient or insentient; and\\nconsciously or unconsciously, everything is struggling towards\\nthat goal. The freedom which the saint seeks is very different from\\nthat which the robber seeks; the freedom loved by the saint leads\\nhim to the enjoyment of infinite, unspeakable bliss, while that on\\nwhich the robber has set his heart only forges other bonds for his\\nsoul.\\nThere is to be found in every religion the manifestation of this\\nstruggle towards freedom. It is the groundwork of all morality, of\\nunselfishness, which means getting rid of the idea that men are the\\nsame as their little body. When we see a man doing good work,\\nhelping others, it means that he cannot be confined within the\\nlimited circle of \"me and mine\". There is no limit to this getting\\nout of selfishness. All the great systems of ethics preach absolute\\nunselfishness as the goal. Supposing this absolute unselfishness\\ncan be reached by a man, what becomes of him?

That is the Pravritti, the natural tendency of every\\nhuman being; taking everything from everywhere and heaping it\\naround one centre, that centre being man\\'s own sweet self. When\\nthis tendency begins to break, when it is Nivritti or \"going away\\nfrom,\" then begin morality and religion. Both Pravritti and Nivritti\\nare of the nature of work: the former is evil work, and the latter is\\ngood work. This Nivritti is the fundamental basis of all morality\\nand all religion, and the very perfection of it is entire self-\\nabnegation, readiness to sacrifice mind and body and everything\\nfor another being. When a man has reached that state, he has\\nattained to the perfection of Karma-Yoga. This is the highest\\nresult of good works. Although a man has not studied a single\\nsystem of philosophy, although he does not believe in any God,\\nand never has believed, although he has not prayed even once in\\nhis whole life, if the simple power of good actions has brought\\nhim to that state where he is ready to give up his life and all else\\nfor others, he has arrived at the same point to which the religious\\nman will come through his prayers and the philosopher through\\nhis knowledge; and so you may find that the philosopher, the\\nworker, and the devotee, all meet at one point, that one point\\nbeing self-abnegation.

The classes were\\nfree of charge. Generally the Swami held two classes daily- morning\\nand evening.\\nAlthough the Swami delivered many lectures and held numerous classes\\nin the two years and five months he had been in America, these lectures\\nconstituted a departure in the way they were recorded. Just prior to the\\ncommencement of his Winter -95-96 season in NYC, his friends and\\nsupporters aided him by advertising for and ultimately hiring a\\nprofessional stenographer: The man selected, Joseph Josiah Goodwin,\\nlater became a disciple of the Swami and followed him to England andGoodwin's transcriptions of the Swami's lectures form the basis of five\\nbooks.\\nCHAPTER 1\\nKarma in its effect on\\ncharacter\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (2 of\", 'The word Karma is derived from the Sanskrit Kri, to do; all action\\nis Karma. Technically, this word also means the effects of actions.\\nIn connection with metaphysics, it sometimes means the effects,\\nof which our past actions were the causes. But in Karma-Yoga we\\nhave simply to do with the word Karma as meaning work. The\\ngoal of mankind is knowledge. That is the one ideal placed before\\nus by Eastern philosophy. Pleasure is not the goal of man, but\\nknowledge. Pleasure and happiness come to an end. It is a mistake\\nto suppose that pleasure is the goal. The cause of all the miseries\\nwe have in the world is that men foolishly think pleasure to be the\\nideal to strive for. After a time man finds that it is not happiness,\\nbut knowledge, towards which he is going, and that both pleasure\\nand pain are great teachers, and that he learns as much from evil\\nas from good. As pleasure and pain pass before his soul they have\\nupon it different pictures, and the result of these combined\\nimpressions is what is called man\\'s \"character\". If you take the\\ncharacter of any man, it really is but the aggregate of tendencies,\\nthe sum total of the bent of his mind; you will find that misery and\\nhappiness are equal factors in the formation of that character.\\nGood and evil have an equal share in moulding character, and in\\nsome instances misery is a greater teacher than happiness. In\\nstudying the great characters the world has produced, I dare say, in\\nthe vast majority of cases, it would be found that it was misery\\nthat taught more than happiness, it was poverty that taught more\\nthan wealth, it was blows that brought out their inner fire more\\nthan praise.\\nNow this knowledge, again, is inherent in man. No knowledge\\ncomes from outside; it is all inside. What we say a man \"knows\",\\nshould, in strict psychological language, be what he \"discovers\" or\\n\"unveils\"; what a man \"learns\" is really what he \"discovers\", by\\ntaking the cover off his own soul, which is a mine of infinite\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (3 of', 'knowledge.\\nWe say Newton discovered gravitation. Was it sitting anywhere in\\na corner waiting for him? It was in his own mind; the time came\\nand he found it out. All knowledge that the world has ever\\nreceived comes from the mind; the infinite library of the universe\\nis in your own mind. The external world is simply the suggestion,\\nthe occasion, which sets you to study your own mind, but the\\nobject of your study is always your own mind. The falling of an\\napple gave the suggestion to Newton, and he studied his own\\nmind. He rearranged all the previous links of thought in his mind\\nand discovered a new link among them, which we call the law of\\ngravitation. It was not in the apple nor in anything in the centre of\\nthe earth.\\nAll knowledge, therefore, secular or spiritual, is in the human\\nmind. In many cases it is not discovered, but remains covered, and\\nwhen the covering is being slowly taken off, we say, \"We are\\nlearning,\" and the advance of knowledge is made by the advance\\nof this process of uncovering. The man from whom this veil is\\nbeing lifted is the more knowing man, the man upon whom it lies\\nthick is ignorant, and the man from whom it has entirely gone is\\nall-knowing, omniscient. There have been omniscient men, and, I\\nbelieve, there will be yet; and that there will be myriads of them in\\nthe cycles to come. Like fire in a piece of flint, knowledge exists\\nin the mind; suggestion is the friction which brings it out. So with\\nall our feelings and actions--our tears and our smiles, our joys and\\nour griefs, our weeping and our laughter, our curses and our\\nblessings, our praises and our blames--every one of these we may\\nfind, if we calmly study our own selves, to have been brought out\\nfrom within ourselves by so many blows. The result is what we\\nare. All these blows taken together are called Karma--work,\\naction. Every mental and physical blow that is given to the soul,\\nby which, as it were, fire is struck from it, and by which its own\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (4 of', 'power and knowledge are discovered, is Karma, this word being\\nused in its widest sense. Thus we are all doing Karma all the time.\\nI am talking to you: that is Karma. You are listening: that is\\nKarma. We breathe: that is Karma. We walk: Karma. Everything\\nwe do, physical or mental, is Karma, and it leaves its marks on us.\\nThere are certain works which are, as it were, the aggregate, the\\nsum total, of a large number of smaller works. If we stand near the\\nseashore and hear the waves dashing against the shingle, we think\\nit is such a great noise, and yet we know that one wave is really\\ncomposed of millions and millions of minute waves. Each one of\\nthese is making a noise, and yet we do not catch it; it is only when\\nthey become the big aggregate that we hear. Similarly, every\\npulsation of the heart is work. Certain kinds of work we feel and\\nthey become tangible to us; they are, at the same time, the\\naggregate of a number of small works. If you really want to judge\\nof the character of a man, look not at his great performances.\\nEvery fool may become a hero at one time or another. Watch a\\nman do his most common actions; those are indeed the things\\nwhich will tell you the real character of a great man. Great\\noccasions rouse even the lowest of human beings to some kind of\\ngreatness, but he alone is the really great man whose character is\\ngreat always, the same wherever he be.\\nKarma in its effect on character is the most tremendous power\\nthan man has to deal with. Man is, as it were, a centre, and is\\nattracting all the powers of the universe towards himself, and in\\nthis centre is fusing them all and again sending them off in a big\\ncurrent. Such a centre is the real man--the almighty, the\\nomniscient--and he draws the whole universe towards him. Good\\nand bad, misery and happiness, all are running towards him and\\nclinging round him; and out of them he fashions the mighty stream\\nof tendency called character and throws it outwards.

As is\\nKarma, so is the manifestation of the will. The men of mighty will\\nthe world has produced have all been tremendous workers--\\ngigantic souls, with wills powerful enough to overturn worlds,\\nwills they got by persistent work, through ages, and ages.

A fool may buy all the books in the world, and\\nthey will be in his library; but he will be able to read only those\\nthat he deserves to; and this deserving is produced by Karma. Our\\nKarma determines what we deserve and what we can assimilate.\\nWe are responsible for what we are; and whatever we wish\\nourselves to be, we have the power to make ourselves. If what we\\nare now has been the result of our own past actions, it certainly\\nfollows that whatever we wish to be in future can be produced by\\nour present actions; so we have to know how to act. You will say,\\n\"What is the use of learning how to work? Everyone works in\\nsome way or other in this world.\" But there is such a thing as\\nfrittering away our energies. With regard to Karma-Yoga, the Gita\\nsays that it is doing work with cleverness and as a science; by\\nknowing how to work, one can obtain the greatest results. You\\nmust remember that all work is simply to bring out the power of\\nthe mind which is already there, to wake up the soul. The power is\\ninside every man, so is knowing; the different works are like\\nblows to bring them out, to cause these giants to wake up.\\nMan works with various motives. There cannot be work without\\nmotive. Some people want to get fame, and they work for fame.\\nOthers want money, and they work for money. Others want to\\nhave power, and they work for power. Others want to get to\\nheaven, and they work for the same. Others want to leave a name\\nwhen they die, as they do in China, where no man gets a title until\\nhe is dead; and that is a better way, after all, than with us. When a\\nman does something very good there, they give a title of nobility\\nto his father, who is dead, or to his grandfather. Some people work\\nfor that. Some of the followers of certain Mohammedan sects\\nwork all their lives to have a big tomb built for them when they\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (7 of', \"die. I know sects among whom, as soon as a child is born, a tomb\\nis prepared for it; that is among them the most important work a\\nman has to do, and the bigger and the finer the tomb, the better off\\nthe man is supposed to be. Others work as a penance; do all sorts\\nof wicked things, then erect a temple, or give something to the\\npriests to buy them off and obtain from them a passport to heaven.\\nThey think that this kind of beneficence will clear them and they\\nwill go scot-free in spite of their sinfulness. Such are some of the\\nvarious motives for work.\\nWork for work's sake. There are some who are really the salt of\\nthe earth in every country and who work for work's sake, who do\\nnot care for name, or fame, or even to go to heaven. They work\\njust because good will come of it. There are others who do good to\\nthe poor and help mankind from still higher motives, because they\\nbelieve in doing good and love good. The motive for name and\\nfame seldom brings immediate results, as a rule; they come to us\\nwhen we are old and have almost done with life. If a man works\\nwithout any selfish motive in view, does he not gain anything?\\nYes, he gains the highest. Unselfishness is more paying, only\\npeople have not the patience to practise it. It is more paying from\\nthe point of view of health also. Love, truth and unselfishness are\\nnot merely moral figures of speech, but they form our highest\\nideal, because in them lies such a manifestation of power. In the\\nfirst place, a man who can work for five days, or even for five\\nminutes, without any selfish motive whatever, without thinking of\\nfuture, of heaven, of punishment, or anything of the kind, has in\\nhim the capacity to become a powerful moral giant. It is hard to do\\nit, but in the heart of our hearts we know its value, and the good it\\nbrings. It is the greatest manifestation of power--this tremendous\\nrestraint; self-restraint is a manifestation of greater power than all\\noutgoing action. A carriage with four horses may rush down a hill\\nunrestrained, or the coachman may curb the horses. Which is the\\ngreater manifestation of power, to let them go or to hold them?

All outgoing energy following a\\nselfish motive is frittered away; it will not cause power to return to\\nyou; but if restrained, it will result in development of power. This\\nself-control will tend to produce a mighty will, a character which\\nmakes a Christ or a Buddha. Foolish men do not know this secret;\\nthey nevertheless want to rule mankind. Even a fool may rule the\\nwhole world if he works and waits. Let him wait a few years,\\nrestrain that foolish idea of governing; and when that idea is\\nwholly gone, he will be a power in the world. The majority of us\\ncannot see beyond a few years, just as some animals cannot see\\nbeyond a few steps. Just a little narrow circle--that is our world.\\nWe have not the patience to look beyond, and thus become\\nimmoral and wicked. This is our weakness, our powerlessness.\\nEven the lowest forms of work are not to be despised. Let the\\nman, who knows no better, work for selfish ends, for name and\\nfame; but everyone should always try to get towards higher and\\nhigher motives and to understand them. \"To work we have the\\nright, but not to the fruits thereof.\" Leave the fruits alone. Why\\ncare for results? If you wish to help a man, never think what that\\nman\\'s attitude should be towards you. If you want to do a great or\\na good work, do not trouble to think what the result will be.\\nThere arises a difficult question in this ideal of work. Intense\\nactivity is necessary; we must always work. We cannot live a\\nminute without work. What then becomes of rest? Here is one side\\nof the life-struggle--work, in which we are whirled rapidly round.\\nAnd here is the other--that of calm, retiring renunciation:\\neverything is peaceful around, there is very little of noise and\\nshow, only nature with her animals and flowers and mountains.\\nNeither of them is a perfect picture.

He\\ngoes through the streets of a big city with all its traffic, and his\\nmind is as calm as if he were in a cave, where not a sound could\\nreach him; and he is intensely working all the time. That is the\\nideal of Karma- Yoga, and if you have attained to that you have\\nreally learnt the secret of work.\\nBut we have to begin from the beginning, to take up the works as\\nthey come to us and slowly make ourselves more unselfish every\\nday. We must do the work and find out the motive power that\\nprompts us; and, almost without exception, in the first years, we\\nshall find that our motives are always selfish; but gradually this\\nselfishness will melt by persistence, till at last will come the time\\nwhen we shall be able to do really unselfish work. We may all\\nhope that some day or other, as we struggle through the paths of\\nlife, there will come a time when we shall become perfectly\\nunselfish; and the moment we attain to that, all our powers will be\\nconcentrated, and the knowledge which is ours will be manifest.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (10 of', 'CHAPTER 2\\nEach is great in his own place\\nAccording to the Sankhya philosophy, nature is composed of three\\nforces called, in Sanskrit, Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. These as\\nmanifested in the physical world are what we may call\\nequilibrium, activity, and inertness. Tamas is typified as darkness\\nor inactivity; Rajas is activity, expressed as attraction or repulsion;\\nand Sattva is the equilibrium of the two. In every man there are\\nthese three forces. Sometimes Tamas prevails. We become lazy,\\nwe cannot move, we are inactive, bound down by certain ideas or\\nby mere dullness. At other times activity prevails, and at still other\\ntimes that calm balancing of both. Again, in different men, one of\\nthese forces is generally predominant. The characteristic of one\\nman is inactivity, dullness and laziness; that of another, activity,\\npower, manifestation of energy; and in still another we find the\\nsweetness, calmness, and gentleness, which are due to the\\nbalancing of both action and inaction. So in all creation--in\\nanimals, plants, and men--we find the more or less typical\\nmanifestation of all these different forces.\\nKarma-Yoga has specially to deal with these three factors. By\\nteaching what they are and how to employ them, it helps us to do\\nour work better. Human society is a graded organisation. We all\\nknow about morality, and we all know about duty, but at the same\\ntime we find that in different countries the significance of\\nmorality varies greatly. What is regarded as moral in one country\\nmay in another be considered perfectly immoral. For instance, in\\none country cousins may marry; in another, it is thought to be very\\nimmoral; in one, men may marry their sisters-in-law; in another, it\\nis regarded as immoral; in one country people may marry only\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (11 of', 'once; in another, many times; and so forth. Similarly, in all other\\ndepartments of morality, we find the standard varies greatly- yet\\nwe have the idea that there must be a universal standard of\\nmorality.\\nSo it is with duty. The idea of duty varies much among different\\nnations. In one country, if a man does not do certain things, people\\nwill say he has acted wrongly; while if he does those very things\\nin another country, people will say that he did not act rightly--and\\nyet we know that there must be some universal idea of duty. In the\\nsame way, one class of society thinks that certain things are\\namong its duty, while another class thinks quite the opposite and\\nwould be horrified if it had to do those things. Two ways are left\\nopen to us--the way of the ignorant, who think that there is only\\none way to truth and that all the rest are wrong, and the way of the\\nwise, who admit that, according to our mental constitution or the\\ndifferent planes of existence in which we are, duty and morality\\nmay vary. The important thing is to know that there are gradations\\nof duty and of morality--that the duty of one state of life, in one\\nset of circumstances, will not and cannot be that of another.\\nTo illustrate: All great teachers have taught, \"Resist not evil,\" that\\nnon-resistance is the highest moral ideal. We all know that, if a\\ncertain number of us attempted to put that maxim fully into\\npractice, the whole social fabric would fall to pieces, the wicked\\nwould take possession of our properties and our lives, and would\\ndo whatever they like with us. Even if only one day of such non-\\nresistance were practised, it would lead to disaster. Yet,\\nintuitively, in our heart of hearts we feel the truth of the teaching\\n\"Resist not evil.\" This seems to us to be the highest ideal; yet to\\nteach this doctrine only would be equivalent to condemning a vast\\nportion of mankind. Not only so, it would be making men feel that\\nthey were always doing wrong, and cause in them scruples of\\nconscience in all their actions; it would weaken them, and that\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (12 of', 'constant self-disapproval would breed more vice than any other\\nweakness would. To the man who has begun to hate himself the\\ngate to degeneration has already opened; and the same is true of a\\nnation. Our first duty is not to hate ourselves, because to advance\\nwe must have faith in ourselves first and then in God. He who has\\nno faith in himself can never have faith in God. Therefore, the\\nonly alternative remaining to us is to recognise that duty and\\nmorality vary under different circumstances; not that the man who\\nresists evil is doing what is always and in itself wrong, but that in\\nthe different circumstances in which he is placed it may become\\neven his duty to resist evil.\\nIn reading the Bhagavad-Gita, many of you in Western countries\\nmay have felt astonished at the second chapter, wherein Sri\\nKrishna calls Arjuna a hypocrite and a coward because of his\\nrefusal to fight, or offer resistance, on account of his adversaries\\nbeing his friends and relatives, making the plea that non-resistance\\nwas the highest ideal of love. This is a great lesson for us all to\\nlearn, that in all matters the two extremes are alike. The extreme\\npositive and the extreme negative are always similar. When the\\nvibrations of light are too slow, we do not see them, nor do we see\\nthem when they are too rapid. So with sound; when very low in\\npitch, we do not hear it; when very high, we do not hear it either.\\nOf like nature is the difference between resistance and non-\\nresistance. One man does not resist because he is weak, lazy, and\\ncannot, not because he will not; the other man knows that he can\\nstrike an irresistible blow if he likes; yet he not only does not\\nstrike, but blesses his enemies. The one who from weakness\\nresists not commits a sin, and as such cannot receive any benefit\\nfrom the non-resistance; while the other would commit a sin by\\noffering resistance. Buddha gave up his throne and renounced his\\nposition, that was true renunciation; but there cannot be any\\nquestion of renunciation in the case of a beggar who has nothing\\nto renounce. So we must always be careful about what we really\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (13 of', 'mean when we speak of this non-resistance and ideal love. We\\nmust first take care to understand whether we have the power of\\nresistance or not. Then, having the power, if we renounce it and\\ndo not resist, we are doing a grand act of love; but if we cannot\\nresist, and yet, at the same time, try to deceive ourselves into the\\nbelief that we are actuated by motives of the highest love, we are\\ndoing the exact opposite.

That is why Sri Krishna told him\\nthat he was a hypocrite; Thou talkest like a wise man, but thy\\nactions betray thee to be a coward; therefore stand up and fight!\\nSuch is the central idea of Karma-Yoga. The Karma-Yogi is the\\nman who understands that the highest ideal is non-resistance, and\\nwho also knows that this non-resistance is the highest\\nmanifestation of power in actual possession, and also what is\\ncalled the resisting of evil is but a step on the way towards the\\nmanifestation of this highest power, namely, non-resistance.\\nBefore reaching this highest ideal, man\\'s duty is to resist evil; let\\nhim work, let him fight, let him strike straight from the shoulder.\\nThen only, when he has gained the power to resist, will non-\\nresistance be a virtue.\\nI once met a man in my country whom I had known before as a\\nvery stupid, dull person, who knew nothing and had not the desire\\nto know anything, and was living the life of a brute. He asked me\\nwhat he should do to know God, how he was to get free. \"Can you\\ntell a lie?\" I asked him. \"No,\" he replied. \"Then you must learn to\\ndo so. It is better to tell a lie than to be a brute, or a log of wood.\\nYou are inactive; you have not certainly reached the highest state,\\nwhich is beyond all actions, calm and serene; you are too dull\\neven to do something wicked.\" That was an extreme case, of\\ncourse, and I was joking with him; but what I meant was that a\\nman must be active in order to pass through activity to perfect\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (14 of', 'calmness.\\nInactivity should be avoided by all means. Activity always means\\nresistance. Resist all evils, mental and physical; and when you\\nhave succeeded in resisting, then will calmness come. It is very\\neasy to say, \"Hate nobody, resist not evil,\" but we know what that\\nkind of thing generally means in practice. When the eyes of\\nsociety are turned towards us, we may make a show of non-\\nresistance, but in our hearts it is canker all the time. We feel the\\nutter want of the calm of non-resistance; we feel that it would be\\nbetter for us to resist. If you desire wealth, and know at the same\\ntime that the whole world regards him who aims at wealth as a\\nvery wicked man, you, perhaps, will not dare to plunge into the\\nstruggle for wealth, yet your mind will be running day and night\\nafter money. This is hypocrisy and will serve no purpose. Plunge\\ninto the world, and then, after a time, when you have suffered and\\nenjoyed all that is in it, will renunciation come; then will calmness\\ncome. So fulfil your desire for power and everything else, and\\nafter you have fulfilled the desire, will come the time when you\\nwill know that they are all very little things; but until you have\\nfulfilled this desire, until you have passed through that activity, it\\nis impossible for you to come to the state of calmness, serenity,\\nand self-surrender. These ideas of serenity and renunciation have\\nbeen preached for thousands of years; everybody has heard of\\nthem from childhood, and yet we see very few in the world who\\nhave really reached that stage. I do not know if I have seen twenty\\npersons in my life who are really calm and non-resisting, and I\\nhave travelled over half the world.\\nEvery man should take up his own ideal and endeavour to\\naccomplish it. That is a surer way of progress than taking up other\\nmen\\'s ideals, which he can never hope to accomplish. For\\ninstance, we take a child and at once give him the task of walking\\ntwenty miles.

Let every one do the best\\nhe can for realising his own ideal. Nor is it right that I should be\\njudged by your standard or you by mine.

However men and women\\nmay vary individually, there is unity in the background. The\\ndifferent individual characters and classes of men and women are\\nnatural variations in creation. Hence, we ought not to judge them\\nby the same standard or put the same ideal before them. Such a\\ncourse creates only an unnatural struggle, and the result is that\\nman begins to hate himself and is hindered from becoming\\nreligious and good.

A\\nfool can do heroic deeds when the approbation of society is upon\\nhim, but for a man to constantly do good without caring for the\\napprobation of his fellow men is indeed the highest sacrifice man\\ncan perform.

Therefore, in considering the question of helping\\nothers, we must always strive not to commit the mistake of\\nthinking that physical help is the only help that can be given. It is\\nnot only the last but the least, because it cannot bring about\\npermanent satisfaction. The misery that I feel when I am hungry is\\nsatisfied by eating, but hunger returns; my misery can cease only\\nwhen I am satisfied beyond all want.

The only solution of this problem\\nis to make mankind pure. Ignorance is the mother of all the evil\\nand all the misery we see.

This mark, with the possibility of the\\nwave reappearing, is what is called Samskara.

If a man\\ncontinuously hears bad words, thinks bad thoughts, does bad\\nactions, his mind will be full of bad impressions; and they will\\ninfluence his thought and work without his being conscious of the\\nfact. In fact, these bad impressions are always working, and their\\nresultant must be evil, and that man will be a bad man; he cannot\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (28 of', \"help it.

When a man has done so much good work and thought so\\nmany good thoughts that there is an irresistible tendency in him to\\ndo good, in spite of himself and even if he wishes to do evil, his\\nmind, as the sum total of his tendencies, will not allow him to do\\nso; the tendencies will turn him back; he is completely under the\\ninfluence of the good tendencies. When such is the case, a man's\\ngood character is said to be established.\\nAs the tortoise tucks its feet and head inside the shell, and you\\nmay kill it and break it in pieces, and yet it will not come out,\\neven so the character of that man who has control over his\\nmotives and organs is unchangeably established. He controls his\\nown inner forces, and nothing can draw them out against his will.\\nBy this continuous reflex of good thoughts, good impressions\\nmoving over the surface of the mind, the tendency for doing good\\nbecomes strong, and as the result we feel able to control the\\nIndriyas (the sense-organs, the nerve-centres). Thus alone will\\ncharacter be established, then alone a man gets to truth. Such a\\nman is safe for ever; he cannot do any evil. You may place him in\\nany company, there will be no danger for him. There is a still\\nhigher state than having this good tendency, and that is the desire\\nfor liberation. You must remember that freedom of the soul is the\\ngoal of all Yogas, and each one equally leads to the same result.\\nBy work alone men may get to where Buddha got largely by\\nmeditation or Christ by prayer. Buddha was a working Jnani,\\nChrist was a Bhakta, but the same goal was reached by both of\\nthem. The difficulty is here.

Instead of that, however, we are identifying\\nourselves with nature; we are thinking that the soul is for nature,\\nthat the spirit is for the flesh, and, as the common saying has it, we\\nthink that man \"lives to eat\" and not \"eats to live\". We are\\ncontinually making this mistake; we are regarding nature as\\nourselves and are becoming attached to it; and as soon as this\\nattachment comes, there is the deep impression on the soul, which\\nbinds us down and makes us work not from freedom but like\\nslaves.\\nThe whole gist of this teaching is that you should work like a\\nmaster and not as a slave; work incessantly, but do not do slave\\'s\\nwork.

Every\\nact of love brings happiness; there is no act of love which does not\\nbring peace and blessedness as its reaction. Real existence, real\\nknowledge, and real love are eternally connected with one\\nanother, the three in one: where one of them is, the others also\\nmust be; they are the three aspects of the One without a second--\\nthe Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. When that existence becomes\\nrelative, we see it as the world; that knowledge becomes in its turn\\nmodified into the knowledge of the things of the world; and that\\nbliss forms the foundation of all true love known to the heart of\\nman. Therefore true love can never react so as to cause pain either\\nto the lover or to the beloved. Suppose a man loves a woman; he\\nwishes to have her all to himself and feels extremely jealous about\\nher every movement; he wants her to sit near him, to stand near\\nhim, and to eat and move at his bidding. He is a slave to her and\\nwishes to have her as his slave. That is not love; it is a kind of\\nmorbid affection of the slave, insinuating itself as love. It cannot\\nbe love, because it is painful; if she does not do what he wants, it\\nbrings him pain. With love there is no painful reaction; love only\\nbrings a reaction of bliss; if it does not, it is not love; it is\\nmistaking something else for love. When you have succeeded in\\nloving your husband, your wife, your children, the whole world,\\nthe universe, in such a manner that there is no reaction of pain or\\njealousy, no selfish feeling, then you are in a fit state to be\\nunattached.\\nKrishna says, \"Look at Me, Arjuna! If I stop from work for one\\nmoment, the whole universe will die. I have nothing to gain from\\nwork; I am the one Lord, but why do I work?

So the poor Brahmin\\nsaid, \"Come in, sir; you are welcome.\" He set before the guest his\\nown portion of the food, which the guest quickly ate and said,\\n\"Oh, sir, you have killed me; I have been starving for ten days,\\nand this little bit has but increased my hunger.\" Then the wife said\\nto her husband, \"Give him my share,\" but the husband said, \"Not\\nso.\" The wife however insisted, saying, \"Here is a poor man, and\\nit is our duty as householders to see that he is fed, and it is my\\nduty as a wife to give him my portion, seeing that you have no\\nmore to offer him.\" Then she gave her share to the guest, which he\\nate, and said he was still burning with hunger.

When I was first learning English, I read an\\nEnglish story book in which there was a story about a dutiful boy\\nwho had gone out to work and had given some of his money to his\\nold mother, and this was praised in three or four pages. What was\\nthat? No Hindu boy can ever understand the moral of that story.\\nNow I understand it when I hear the Western idea--every man for\\nhimself.

The idea of duty again is different in different\\nnations. The Mohammedan says what is written in his book, the\\nKoran, is his duty; the Hindu says what is in the Vedas is his duty;\\nand the Christian says what is in the Bible is his duty. We find that\\nthere are varied ideas of duty, differing according to different\\nstates in life, different historical periods and different nations. The\\nterm \"duty\", like every other universal abstract term, is impossible\\nclearly to define; we can only get an idea of it by knowing its\\npractical operations and results. When certain things occur before\\nus, we have all a natural or trained impulse to act in a certain\\nmanner towards them; when this impulse comes, the mind begins\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (36 of', 'to think about the situation. Sometimes it thinks that it is good to\\nact in a particular manner under the given conditions; at other\\ntimes it thinks that it is wrong to act in the same manner even in\\nthe very same circumstances. The ordinary idea of duty\\neverywhere is that every good man follows the dictates of his\\nconscience. But what is it that makes an act a duty? If a Christian\\nfinds a piece of beef before him and does not eat it to save his own\\nlife, or will not give it to save the life of another man, he is sure to\\nfeel that he has not done his duty. But if a Hindu dares to eat that\\npiece of beef or to give it to another Hindu, he is equally sure to\\nfeel that he too has not done his duty; the Hindu\\'s training and\\neducation make him feel that way. In the last century there were\\nnotorious bands of robbers in India called thugs; they thought it\\ntheir duty to kill any man they could and take away his money; the\\nlarger the number of men they killed, the better they thought they\\nwere. Ordinarily if a man goes out into the street and shoots down\\nanother man, he is apt to feel sorry for it, thinking that he has done\\nwrong. But if the very same man, as a soldier in his regiment, kills\\nnot one but twenty, he is certain to feel glad and think that he has\\ndone his duty remarkable well. Therefore we see that it is not the\\nthing done that defines a duty. To give an objective definition of\\nduty is thus entirely impossible. Yet there is duty from the\\nsubjective side. Any action that makes us go Godward is a good\\naction, and is our duty; any action that makes us go downward is\\nevil, and is not our duty. From the subjective standpoint we may\\nsee that certain acts have a tendency to exalt and ennoble us, while\\ncertain other acts have a tendency to degrade and to brutalise us.\\nBut it is not possible to make out with certainty which acts have\\nwhich kind of tendency in relation to all persons, of all sorts and\\nconditions. There is, however, only one idea of duty which has\\nbeen universally accepted by all mankind, of all ages and sects\\nand countries, and that has been summed up in a Sanskrit\\naphorism thus: \"Do not injure any being; not injuring any being is\\nvirtue, injuring any being is sin.\"\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (37 of', 'The Bhagavad Gita frequently alludes to duties dependent upon\\nbirth and position in life. Birth and position in life and in society\\nlargely determine the mental and moral attitude of individuals\\ntowards the various activities of life. It is therefore our duty to do\\nthat work which will exalt and ennoble us in accordance with the\\nideals and activities of the society in which we are born. But it\\nmust be particularly remembered that the same ideals and\\nactivities do not prevail in all societies and countries; our\\nignorance of this is the main cause of much of the hatred of one\\nnation towards another. An American thinks that whatever an\\nAmerican does in accordance with the custom of his country is the\\nbest thing to do, and that whoever does not follow his custom\\nmust be a very wicked man. A Hindu thinks that his customs are\\nthe only right ones and are the best in the world, and that\\nwhosoever does not obey them must be the most wicked man\\nliving. This is quite a natural mistake which all of us are apt to\\nmake. But it is very harmful; it is the cause of half the\\nuncharitableness found in the world.

When I asked him the reason, he also was ashamed\\nand stammered out an apology saying, \"Why do you dress that\\nway?\" The sympathies of these men were limited within the range\\nof their own language and their own fashion of dress. Much of the\\noppression of powerful nations on weaker ones is caused by this\\nprejudice. It dries up their fellow-feeling for fellow men. That\\nvery man who asked me why I did not dress as he did and wanted\\nto ill-treat me because of my dress may have been a very good\\nman, a good father, and a good citizen; but the kindliness of his\\nnature died out as soon as he saw a man in a different dress.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (38 of', 'Strangers are exploited in all countries, because they do not know\\nhow to defend themselves; thus they carry home false impressions\\nof the peoples they have seen.

They\\ncould not have done this if they had met the good, the kindly sides\\nof Western life.\\nTherefore the one point we ought to remember is that we should\\nalways try to see the duty of others through their own eyes, and\\nnever judge the customs of other peoples by our own standard.

So we see that\\nenvironments change the nature of our duties, and doing the duty\\nwhich is ours at any particular time is the best thing we can do in\\nthis world. Let us do that duty which is ours by birth; and when\\nwe have done that, let us do the duty which is ours by our position\\nin life and in society. There is, however, one great danger in\\nhuman nature, viz. that man never examines himself. He thinks he\\nis quite as fit to be on the throne as the king. Even if he is, he must\\nfirst show that he has done the duty of his own position; and then\\nhigher duties will come to him.

It contains one of the\\nhighest flights of the Vedanta. When the Vyadha finished his\\nteaching, the Sannyasin felt astonished. He said, \"Why are you in\\nthat body? With such knowledge as yours why are you in a\\nVyadha\\'s body, and doing such filthy, ugly work?\" \"My son,\"\\nreplied the Vyadha, \"no duty is ugly, no duty is impure.

We are all apt to think too highly of\\nourselves. Our duties are determined by our deserts to a much\\nlarger extent than we are willing to grant. Competition rouses\\nenvy, and it kills the kindliness of the heart. To the grumbler all\\nduties are distasteful; nothing will ever satisfy him, and his whole\\nlife is doomed to prove a failure.

In every\\nreligion there are three parts: philosophy, mythology, and ritual.\\nPhilosophy of course is the essence of every religion; mythology\\nexplains and illustrates it by means of the more or less legendary\\nlives of great men, stories and fables of wonderful things, and so\\non; ritual gives to that philosophy a still more concrete form, so\\nthat every one may grasp it--ritual is in fact concretised\\nphilosophy. This ritual is Karma; it is necessary in every religion,\\nbecause most of us cannot understand abstract spiritual things\\nuntil we grow much spiritually. It is easy for men to think that\\nthey can understand anything; but when it comes to practical\\nexperience, they find that abstract ideas are often very hard to\\ncomprehend. Therefore symbols are of great help, and we cannot\\ndispense with the symbolical method of putting things before us.\\nFrom time immemmorial symbols have been used by all kinds of\\nreligions. In one sense we cannot think but in symbols; words\\nthemselves are symbols of thought. In another sense everything in\\nthe universe may be looked upon as a symbol. The whole universe\\nis a symbol, and God is the essence behind. This kind of\\nsymbology is not simply the creation of man; it is not that certain\\npeople belonging to a religion sit down together and think out\\ncertain symbols, and bring them into existence out of their own\\nminds. The symbols of religion have a natural growth. Otherwise,\\nwhy is it that certain symbols are associated with certain ideas in\\nthe mind of almost every one? Certain symbols are universally\\nprevalent. Many of you may think that the cross first came into\\nexistence as a symbol in connection with the Christian religion,\\nbut as a matter of fact it existed before Christianity was, before\\nMoses was born, before the Vedas were given out, before there\\nwas any human record of human things. The cross may be found\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (45 of', \"to have been in existence among the Aztecs and the Phoenicians;\\nevery race seems to have had the cross. Again, the symbol of the\\ncrucified Savior, of a man crucified upon a cross, appears to have\\nbeen known to almost every nation. The circle has been a great\\nsymbol throughout the world. Then there is the most universal of\\nall symbols, the Swastika. At one time it was thought that the\\nBuddhists carried it all over the world with them, but it has been\\nfound out that ages before Buddhism it was used among nations.\\nIn Old Babylon and in Egypt it was to be found. What does this\\nshow? All these symbols could not have been purely\\nconventional. There must be some reason for them; some natural\\nassociation between them and the human mind. Language is not\\nthe result of convention; it is not that people ever agreed to\\nrepresent certain ideas by certain words; there never was an idea\\nwithout a corresponding word or a word without a corresponding\\nidea; ideas and words are in their nature inseparable. The symbols\\nto represent ideas may be sound symbols or colour symbols. Deaf\\nand dumb people have to think with other than sound symbols.\\nEvery thought in the mind has a form as its counterpart. This is\\ncalled in Sanskrit philosophy Nama-Rupa--name and form. It is as\\nimpossible to create by convention a system of symbols as it is to\\ncreate a language. In the world's ritualistic symbols we have an\\nexpression of the religious thought of humanity. It is easy to say\\nthat there is no use of rituals and temples and all such\\nparaphernalia; every baby says that in modern times. But it must\\nbe easy for all to see that those who worship inside a temple are in\\nmany respects different from those who will not worship there.\\nTherefore the association of particular temples, rituals, and other\\nconcrete forms with particular religions has a tendency to bring\\ninto the minds of the followers of those religions the thoughts for\\nwhich those concrete things stand as symbols; and it is not wise to\\nignore rituals and symbology altogether. The study and practice of\\nthese things form naturally a part of Karma-Yoga.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (46 of\", 'There are many other aspects of this science of work.

In every religion the\\npower of the word is recognised, so much so that in some of them\\ncreation itself is said to have come out of the word. The external\\naspect of the thought of God is the Word, and as God thought and\\nwilled before He created, creation came out of the Word. In this\\nstress and hurry of our materialistic life, our nerves lose\\nsensibility and become hardened. The older we grow, the longer\\nwe are knocked about in the world, the more callous we become;\\nand we are apt to neglect things that even happen persistently and\\nprominently around us. Human nature, however, asserts itself\\nsometimes, and we are led to inquire into and wonder at some of\\nthese common occurrences; wondering thus is the first step in the\\nacquisition of light. Apart from the higher philosophic and\\nreligious value of the Word, we may see that sound symbols play\\na prominent part in the drama of human life. I am talking to you.

This intensification of the\\ninfluence of action cannot be explained on any other ground than\\nthat we can act and react upon each other. To take an illustration\\nfrom physical science, when I am doing a certain action, my mind\\nmay be said to be in a certain state of vibration; all minds which\\nare in similar circumstances will have the tendency to be affected\\nby my mind. If there are different musical instruments tuned alike\\nin one room, all of you may have noticed that when one is struck,\\nthe others have the tendency to vibrate so as to give the same\\nnote.

Of course, this influence of\\nthought on mind will vary according to distance and other causes,\\nbut the mind is always open to affection. Suppose I am doing an\\nevil act, my mind is in a certain state of vibration, and all minds in\\nthe universe, which are in a similar state, have the possibility of\\nbeing affected by the vibration of my mind.

It is quite\\npossible, therefore, that this atmosphere of ours is full of such\\nthought pulsations, both good and evil. Every thought projected\\nfrom every brain goes on pulsating, as it were, until it meets a fit\\nobject that will receive it. Any mind which is open to receive\\nsome of these impulses will take them immediately. So, when a\\nman is doing evil actions, he has brought his mind to a certain\\nstate of tension and all the waves which correspond to that state of\\ntension, and which may be said to be already in the atmosphere,\\nwill struggle to enter into his mind. That is why an evil-doer\\ngenerally goes on doing more and more evil. His actions become\\nintensified. Such, also will be the case with the doer of good; he\\nwill open himself to all the good waves that are in the atmosphere,\\nand his good actions also will become intensified. We run,\\ntherefore, a twofold danger in doing evil: first, we open ourselves\\nto all the evil influences surrounding us; secondly, we create evil\\nwhich affects others, may be hundreds of years hence. In doing\\nevil we injure ourselves and others also. In doing good we do\\ngood to ourselves and to others as well; and, like all other forces\\nin man, these forces of good and evil also gather strength from\\noutside.\\nAccording to Karma-Yoga, the action one has done cannot be\\ndestroyed until it has borne its fruit; no power in nature can stop it\\nfrom yielding its results.

Now comes a very fine and serious\\nquestion about Karma-Yoga--namely, that these actions of ours,\\nboth good and evil, are intimately connected with each other. We\\ncannot put a line of demarcation and say, this action is entirely\\ngood and this entirely evil. There is no action which does not bear\\ngood and evil fruits at the same time. To take the nearest example:\\nI am talking to you, and some of you, perhaps, think I am doing\\ngood; and at the same time I am, perhaps, killing thousands of\\nmicrobes in the atmosphere; I am thus doing evil to something\\nelse. When it is very near to us and affects those we know, we say\\nthat it is very good action if it affects them in a good manner. For\\ninstance, you may call my speaking to you very good, but the\\nmicrobes will not; the microbes you do not see, but yourselves\\nyou do see. The way in which my talk affects you is obvious to\\nyou, but how it affects the microbes is not so obvious. And so, if\\nwe analyse our evil actions also, we may find that some good\\npossibly results from them somewhere. He who in good action\\nsees that there is something evil in it, and in the midst of evil sees\\nthat there is something good in it somewhere, has known the\\nsecret of work.\\nBut what follows from it? That, howsoever we may try, there\\ncannot be any action which is perfectly pure, or any which is\\nperfectly impure, taking purity and impurity in the sense of injury\\nand non-injury. We cannot breathe or live without injuring others,\\nand every bit of the food we eat is taken away from another's\\nmouth. Our very lives are crowding out other lives. It may be\\nmen, or animals, or small microbes, but some one or other of\\nthese we have to crowd out. That being the case, it naturally\\nfollows that perfection can never be attained by work.

It is said\\nby a Sanskrit poet that there is a fourth unnamable class of people\\nwho injure others merely for injury\\'s sake. Just as there are at one\\npole of existence the highest good men, who do good for the sake\\nof doing good, so, at the other pole, there are others who injure\\nothers just for the sake of the injury. They do not gain anything\\nthereby, but it is their nature to do evil.\\nHere are two Sanskrit words. The one is Pravritti, which means\\nrevolving towards, and the other is Nivritti, which means\\nrevolving away. The \"revolving towards\" is what we call the\\nworld, the \"I and mine\"; it includes all those things which are\\nalways enriching that \"me\" by wealth and money and power, and\\nname and fame, and which are of a grasping nature, always\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (57 of', 'tending to accumulate everything in one centre, that centre being\\n\"myself\". That is the Pravritti, the natural tendency of every\\nhuman being; taking everything from everywhere and heaping it\\naround one centre, that centre being man\\'s own sweet self. When\\nthis tendency begins to break, when it is Nivritti or \"going away\\nfrom,\" then begin morality and religion. Both Pravritti and Nivritti\\nare of the nature of work: the former is evil work, and the latter is\\ngood work. This Nivritti is the fundamental basis of all morality\\nand all religion, and the very perfection of it is entire self-\\nabnegation, readiness to sacrifice mind and body and everything\\nfor another being. When a man has reached that state, he has\\nattained to the perfection of Karma-Yoga. This is the highest\\nresult of good works. Although a man has not studied a single\\nsystem of philosophy, although he does not believe in any God,\\nand never has believed, although he has not prayed even once in\\nhis whole life, if the simple power of good actions has brought\\nhim to that state where he is ready to give up his life and all else\\nfor others, he has arrived at the same point to which the religious\\nman will come through his prayers and the philosopher through\\nhis knowledge; and so you may find that the philosopher, the\\nworker, and the devotee, all meet at one point, that one point\\nbeing self-abnegation. However much their systems of philosophy\\nand religion may differ, all mankind stand in reverence and awe\\nbefore the man who is ready to sacrifice himself for others. Here,\\nit is not at all any question of creed, or doctrine- even men who\\nare very much opposed to all religious ideas, when they see one of\\nthese acts of complete self-sacrifice, feel that they must revere it.\\nHave you not seen even a most bigoted Christian, when he reads\\nEdwin Arnold\\'s Light of Asia, stand in reverence of Buddha, who\\npreached no God, preached nothing but self-sacrifice? The only\\nthing is that the bigot does not know that his own end and aim in\\nlife is exactly the same as that of those from whom he differs. The\\nworshipper, by keeping constantly before him the idea of God and\\na surrounding of good, comes to the same point at last and says,\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (58 of', '\"Thy will be done,\" and keeps nothing to himself. That is self-\\nabnegation. The philosopher, with his knowledge, sees that the\\nseeming self is a delusion and easily gives it up. It is self-\\nabnegation. So Karma, Bhakti, and Jnana all meet here; and this is\\nwhat was meant by all the great preachers of ancient times, when\\nthey taught that God is not the world. There is one thing which is\\nthe world and another which is God; and this distinction is very\\ntrue. What they mean by world is selfishness. Unselfishness is\\nGod. One may live on a throne, in a golden palace, and be\\nperfectly unselfish; and then he is in God. Another may live in a\\nhut and wear rags, and have nothing in the world; yet, if he is\\nselfish, he is intensely merged in the world.\\nTo come back to one of our main points, we say that we cannot do\\ngood without at the same time doing some evil, or do evil without\\ndoing some good. Knowing this, how can we work? There have,\\ntherefore, been sects in this world who have in an astoundingly\\npreposterous way preached slow suicide as the only means to get\\nout of the world, because if a man lives, he has to kill poor little\\nanimals and plants or do injury to something or some one. So\\naccording to them the only way out of the world is to die. The\\nJains have preached this doctrine as their highest ideal. This\\nteaching seems to be very logical. But the true solution is found in\\nthe Gita. It is the theory of non-attachment, to be attached to\\nnothing while doing our work of life. Know that you are separated\\nentirely from the world, though you are in the world, and that\\nwhatever you may be doing in it, you are not doing that for your\\nown sake. Any action that you do for yourself will bring its effect\\nto bear upon you. If it is a good action, you will have to take the\\ngood effect, and if bad, you will have to take the bad effect; but\\nany action that is not done for your own sake, whatever it be, will\\nhave no effect on you. There is to be found a very expressive\\nsentence in our scriptures embodying this idea: \"Even if he kill\\nthe whole universe (or be himself killed), he is neither the killer\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (59 of', 'nor the killed, when he knows that he is not acting for himself at\\nall.\" Therefore Karma-Yoga teaches, \"Do not give up the world;\\nlive in the world, imbibe its influences as much as you can; but if\\nit be for your own enjoyment\\'s sake, work not at all.\" Enjoyment\\nshould not be the goal. First kill your self and then take the whole\\nworld as yourself; as the old Christians used to say, \"The old man\\nmust die.\" This old man is the selfish idea that the whole world is\\nmade for our enjoyment. Foolish parents teach their children to\\npray, \"O Lord, Thou hast created this sun for me and this moon\\nfor me,\" as if the Lord has had nothing else to do than to create\\neverything for these babies. Do not teach your children such\\nnonsense. Then again, there are people who are foolish in another\\nway: they teach us that all these animals were created for us to kill\\nand eat, and that this universe is for the enjoyment of men. That is\\nall foolishness. A tiger may say, \"Man was created for me,\" and\\npray, \"O Lord, how wicked are these men who do not come and\\nplace themselves before me to be eaten; they are breaking Your\\nlaw.\" If the world is created for us, we are also created for the\\nworld. That this world is created for our enjoyment is the most\\nwicked idea that holds us down. This world is not for our sake.\\nMillions pass out of it every year; the world does not feel it;\\nmillions of others are supplied in their place. Just as much as the\\nworld is for us, so we also are for the world. To work properly,\\ntherefore, you have first to give up the idea of attachment.\\nSecondly, do not mix in the fray, hold yourself as a witness and\\ngo on working. My master used to say, \"Look upon your children\\nas a nurse does.\" The nurse will take your baby and fondle it and\\nplay with it and behave towards it as gently as if it were her own\\nchild; but as soon as you give her notice to quit, she is ready to\\nstart off bag and baggage from the house. Everything in the shape\\nof attachment is forgotten; it will not give the ordinary nurse the\\nleast pang to leave your children and take up other children. Even\\nso are you to be with all that you consider your own. You are the\\nnurse, and if you believe in God, believe that all these things\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (60 of', \"which you consider yours are really His. The greatest weakness\\noften insinuates itself as the greatest good and strength. It is a\\nweakness to think that any one is dependent on me, and that I can\\ndo good to another. This belief is the mother of all our attachment,\\nand through this attachment comes all our pain. We must inform\\nour minds that no one in this universe depends upon us; not one\\nbeggar depends on our charity; not one soul on our kindness; not\\none living thing on our help. All are helped on by nature, and will\\nbe so helped even though millions of us were not here. The course\\nof nature will not stop for such as you and me; it is, as already\\npointed out, only a blessed privilege to you and to me that we are\\nallowed, in the way of helping others, to educate ourselves. This\\nis a great lesson to learn in life, and when we have learned it fully,\\nwe shall never be unhappy; we can go and mix without harm in\\nsociety anywhere and everywhere. You may have wives and\\nhusbands, and regiments of servants, and kingdoms to govern; if\\nonly you act on the principle that the world is not for you and\\ndoes not inevitably need you, they can do you no harm.

So drive out of your mind the idea that you have to\\ndo something for the world; the world does not require any help\\nfrom you. It is sheer nonsense on the part of any man to think that\\nhe is born to help the world; it is simply pride, it is selfishness\\ninsinuating itself in the form of virtue. When you have trained\\nyour mind and your nerves to realise this idea of the world's non-\\ndependence on you or on anybody, there will then be no reaction\\nin the form of pain resulting from work. When you give\\nsomething to a man and expect nothing--do not even expect the\\nman to be grateful--his ingratitude will not tell upon you, because\\nyou never expected anything, never thought you had any right to\\nanything in the way of a return.

It is only selfishness that causes the difference between good\\nand evil. It is a very hard thing to understand, but you will come\\nto learn in time that nothing in the universe has power over you\\nuntil you allow it to exercise such a power. Nothing has power\\nover the Self of man, until the Self becomes a fool and loses\\nindependence. So, by non-attachment, you overcome and deny the\\npower of anything to act upon you.

This Vyasa is\\nknown as the author of the Vedanta aphorisms, and was a holy\\nman. His father had tried to become a very perfect man and had\\nfailed. His grandfather had also tried and failed. His great-\\ngrandfather had similarly tried and failed. He himself did not\\nsucceed perfectly, but his son, Shuka, was born perfect. Vyasa\\ntaught his son wisdom; and after teaching him the knowledge of\\ntruth himself, he sent him to the court of King Janaka. He was a\\ngreat king and was called Janaka Videha. Videha means \"without\\na body\". Although a king, he had entirely forgotten that he was a\\nbody; he felt that he was a spirit all the time. This boy Shuka was\\nsent to be taught by him. The king knew that Vyasa\\'s son was\\ncoming to him to learn wisdom: so he made certain arrangements\\nbeforehand. And when the boy presented himself at the gates of\\nthe palace, the guards took no notice of him whatsoever. They\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (62 of', 'only gave him a seat, and he sat there for three days and nights,\\nnobody speaking to him, nobody asking him who he was or\\nwhence he was. He was the son of a very great sage, his father\\nwas honoured by the whole country, and he himself was a most\\nrespectable person; yet the low, vulgar guards of the palace would\\ntake no notice of him. After that, suddenly, the ministers of the\\nking and all the big officials came there and received him with the\\ngreatest honours. They conducted him in and showed him into\\nsplendid rooms, gave him the most fragrant baths and wonderful\\ndresses, and for eight days they kept him there in all kinds of\\nluxury. That solemnly serene face of Shuka did not change even\\nto the smallest extent by the change in the treatment accorded to\\nhim; he was the same in the midst of this luxury as when waiting\\nat the door. Then he was brought before the king. The king was on\\nhis throne, music was playing, and dancing and other amusements\\nwere going on. The king then gave him a cup of milk, full to the\\nbrim, and asked him to go seven times round the hall without\\nspilling even a drop. The boy took the cup and proceeded in the\\nmidst of the music and the attraction of the beautiful faces. As\\ndesired by the king, seven times did he go round, and not a drop\\nof the milk was spilt. The boy\\'s mind could not be attracted by\\nanything in the world, unless he allowed it to affect him.

Such a man alone is fit to live well in\\nthe world. We generally find men holding two opinions regarding\\nthe world.

This very world will become to\\nus an optimistic world when we become masters of our own\\nminds. Nothing will then work upon us as good or evil; we shall\\nfind everything to be in its proper place, to be harmonious. Some\\nmen, who begin by saying that the world is a hell, often end by\\nsaying that it is a heaven when they succeed in the practice of self-\\ncontrol. If we are genuine Karma Yogis and wish to train\\nourselves to that attainment of this state, wherever we may begin\\nwe are sure to end in perfect self-abnegation; and as soon as this\\nseeming self has gone, the whole world, which at first appears to\\nus to be filled with evil, will appear to be heaven itself and full of\\nblessedness. Its very atmosphere will be blessed; every human\\nface there will be god. Such is the end and aim of Karma-Yoga,\\nand such is its perfection in practical life. Our various Yogas do\\nnot conflict with each other; each of them leads us to the same\\ngoal and makes us perfect. Only each has to be strenuously\\npractised. The whole secret is in practising. First you have to hear,\\nthen think, and then practise. This is true of every Yoga. You have\\nfirst to hear about it and understand what it is; and many things\\nwhich you do not understand will be made clear to you by\\nconstant hearing and thinking. It is hard to understand everything\\nat once. The explanation of everything is after all in yourself. No\\none was ever really taught by another; each of us has to teach\\nhimself. The external teacher offers only the suggestion which\\nrouses the internal teacher to work to understand things. Then\\nthings will be made clearer to us by our own power of perception\\nand thought, and we shall realise them in our own souls; and that\\nrealisation will grow into the intense power of will. First it is\\nfeeling, then it becomes willing, and out of that willing comes the\\ntremendous force for work that will go through every vein and\\nnerve and muscle, until the whole mass of your body is changed\\ninto an instrument of the unselfish Yoga of work, and the desired\\nresult of perfect self-abnegation and utter unselfishness is duly\\nattained.

If you\\nare, you will be perfect without reading a single religious book,\\nwithout going into a single church or temple. Each one of our\\nYogas is fitted to make man perfect even without the help of the\\nothers, because they have all the same goal in view. The Yogas of\\nwork, of wisdom, and of devotion are all capable of serving as\\ndirect and independent means for the attainment of Moksha.\\n\"Fools alone say that work and philosophy are different, not the\\nlearned.\" The learned know that, though apparently different from\\neach other, they at last lead to the same goal of human perfection.\\nCHAPTER 7\\nFreedom\\nIn addition to meaning work, we have stated that psychologically\\nthe word Karma also implies causation. Any work, any action, any\\nthought that produces an effect is called a Karma. Thus the law of\\nKarma means the law of causation, of inevitable cause and\\nsequence. Wheresoever there is a cause, there an effect must be\\nproduced; this necessity cannot be resisted, and this law of Karma,\\naccording to our philosophy, is true throughout the whole\\nuniverse. Whatever we see, or feel, or do, whatever action there is\\nanywhere in the universe, while being the effect of past work on\\nthe one hand, becomes, on the other, a cause in its turn, and\\nproduces its own effect. It is necessary, together with this, to\\nconsider what is meant by the word \"law\". By law is meant the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (65 of', 'tendency of a series to repeat itself. When we see one event\\nfollowed by another, or sometimes happening simultaneously with\\nanother, we expect this sequence or co-existence to recur. Our old\\nlogicians and philosophers of the Nyaya school call this law by the\\nname of Vyapti. According to them, all our ideas of law are due to\\nassociation. A series of phenomena becomes associated with\\nthings in our mind in a sort of invariable order, so that whatever\\nwe perceive at any time is immediately referred to other facts in\\nthe mind. Any one idea or, according to our psychology, any one\\nwave that is produced in the mind-stuff, Chitta, must always give\\nrise to many similar waves. This is the psychological idea of\\nassociation, and causation is only as aspect of this grand pervasive\\nprinciple of association. This pervasiveness of association is what\\nis, in Sanskrit, called Vyapti. In the external world the idea of law\\nis the same as in the internal--the expectation that a particular\\nphenomenon will be followed by another, and that the series will\\nrepeat itself. Really speaking, therefore, law does not exist in\\nnature. Practically it is an error to say that gravitation exists in the\\nearth, or that there is any law existing objectively anywhere in\\nnature. Law is the method, the manner in which our mind grasps a\\nseries of phenomena; it is all in the mind. Certain phenomena,\\nhappening one after another or together, and followed by the\\nconviction of the regularity of their recurrence--thus enabling our\\nminds to grasp the method of the whole series--constitute what we\\ncall law.\\nThe next question for consideration is what we mean by law being\\nuniversal. Our universe is that portion of existence which is\\ncharacterised by what the Sanskrit psychologists call Desha-kala-\\nnimitta, or what is known to European psychology as space, time,\\nand causation. This universe is only a part of infinite existence,\\nthrown into a peculiar mould, composed of space, time, and\\ncausation. It necessarily follows that law is possible only within\\nthis conditioned universe; beyond it there cannot be any law.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (66 of', 'When we speak of the universe, we only mean that portion of\\nexistence which is limited by our mind--the universe of the senses,\\nwhich we can see, feel, touch, hear, think of, imagine. This alone\\nis under law; but beyond it existence cannot be subject to law,\\nbecause causation does not extend beyond the world of our minds.\\nAnything beyond the range of our mind and our senses is not\\nbound by the law of causation, as there is no mental association of\\nthings in the region beyond the senses, and no causation without\\nassociation of ideas. It is only when \"being\" or existence gets\\nmoulded into name and form that it obeys the law of causation,\\nand is said to be under law; because all law has its essence in\\ncausation. Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such\\nthing as free will; the very words are a contradiction, because will\\nis what we know and everything that we know is within our\\nuniverse, and everything within our universe is mouled by the\\nconditions of space, time, and causation. Everything that we\\nknow, or can possibly know, must be subject to causation, and that\\nwhich obeys the law of causation cannot be free. It is acted upon\\nby other agents, and becomes a cause in its turn. But that which\\nhas become converted into the will, which was not the will before,\\nbut which, when it fell into this mould of space, time, and\\ncausation, became converted into the human will, is free; and\\nwhen this will gets out of this mould of space,time, and causation,\\nit will be free again.

So, when we speak of man as\\nno other than that infinite being which is manifesting itself, we\\nmean that only one very small part thereof is man; this body and\\nthis mind which we see are only one part of the whole, only one\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (67 of', 'spot of the infinite being. This whole universe is only one speck of\\nthe infinite being; and all our laws, our bondages, our joys and our\\nsorrows, our happinesses and our expectations, are only within\\nthis small universe; all our progression and digression are within\\nits small compass. So you see how childish it is to expect a\\ncontinuation of this universe--the creation of our minds--and to\\nexpect to go to heaven, which after all must mean only a repetition\\nof this world that we know. You see at once that it is an\\nimpossible and childish desire to make the whole of infinite\\nexistence conform to the limited and conditioned existence which\\nwe know. When a man says that he will have again and again this\\nsame thing which he is having now, or, as I sometimes put it,\\nwhen he asks for a comfortable religion, you may know that he\\nhas become so degenerate that he cannot think of anything higher\\nthan what he is now; he is just his little present surroundings and\\nnothing more. He has forgotten his infinite nature, and his whole\\nidea is confined to these little joys, and sorrows, and heart-\\njealousies of the moment.

This is also a kind of giving up; only it\\nis done slowly and gradually, by knowing things, enjoying things\\nand thus obtaining experience, and knowing the nature of things\\nuntil the mind lets them all go at last and becomes unattached.

Our nature is far beyond misery and happiness,\\nbeyond every object of the senses, beyond the imagination; and\\nyet we must go on working all the time. \"Misery comes through\\nattachment, not through work.\" As soon as we identify ourselves\\nwith the work we do, we feel miserable; but if we do not identify\\nourselves with it, we do not feel that misery. If a beautiful picture\\nbelonging to another is burnt, a man does not generally become\\nmiserable; but when his own picture is burnt, how miserable he\\nfeels! Why? Both were beautiful pictures, perhaps copies of the\\nsame original; but in one case very much more misery is felt than\\nin the other. It is because in one case he identifies himself with the\\npicture, and not in the other. This \"I and mine\" causes the whole\\nmisery. With the sense of possession comes selfishness, and\\nselfishness brings on misery. Every act of selfishness or thought of\\nselfishness makes us attached to something, and immediately we\\nare made slaves. Each wave in the Chitta that says \"I and mine\"\\nimmediately puts a chain round us and makes us slaves; and the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (71 of', 'more we say \"I and mine\", the more slavery grows, the more\\nmisery increases. Therefore Karma-Yoga tells us to enjoy the\\nbeauty of all the pictures in the world, but not to identify ourselves\\nwith any of them. Never say \"mine\". Whenever we say a thing is\\n\"mine\", misery will immediately come. Do not even say \"my\\nchild\" in your mind. Possess the child, but do not say \"mine\". If\\nyou do, then will come the misery. Do not\\nsay \"my house,\" do not say \"my body\". The whole difficulty is\\nthere. The body is neither yours, nor mine, nor anybody\\'s. These\\nbodies are coming and going by the laws of nature, but we are\\nfree, standing as witness. This body is no more free than a picture\\nor a wall. Why should we be attached so much to a body? If\\nsomebody paints a picture, he does it and passes on. Do not\\nproject that tentacle of selfishness, \"I must possess it\". As soon as\\nthat is projected, misery will begin.\\nSo Karma-Yoga says, first destroy the tendency to project this\\ntentacle of selfishness, and when you have the power of checking\\nit, hold it in and do not allow the mind to get into the ways of\\nselfishness. Then you may go out into the world and work as\\nmuch as you can. Mix everywhere, go where you please; you will\\nnever be contaminated with evil. There is the lotus leaf in the\\nwater; the water cannot touch and adhere to it; so will you be in\\nthe world. This is called \"Vairagya\", dispassion or non-\\nattachment. I believe I have told you that without non-attachment\\nthere cannot be any kind of Yoga. Non-attachment is the basis of\\nall the Yogas. The man who gives up living in houses, wearing\\nfine clothes, and eating good food, and goes into the desert, may\\nbe a most attached person. His only possession, his own body,\\nmay become everything to him; and as he lives he will be simply\\nstruggling for the sake of his body. Non-attachment does not mean\\nanything that we may do in relation to our external body, it is all\\nin the mind. The binding link of \"I and mine\" is in the mind. If we\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (72 of', 'have not this link with the body and with the things of the senses,\\nwe are non-attached, wherever and whatever we may be. A man\\nmay be on a throne and perfectly non-attached; another man may\\nbe in rags and still very much attached. First, we have to attain this\\nstate of non-attachment and then to work incessantly. Karma-\\nYoga gives us the method that will help us in giving up all\\nattachment, though it is indeed very hard.\\nHere are the two ways of giving up all attachment. The one is for\\nthose who do not believe in God, or in any outside help. They are\\nleft to their own devices; they have simply to work with their own\\nwill, with the powers of their mind and discrimination, saying, \"I\\nmust be non-attached\". For those who believe in God there is\\nanother way, which is much less difficult. They give up the fruits\\nof work unto the Lord; they work and are never attached to the\\nresults. Whatever they see, feel, hear, or do, is for Him. For\\nwhatever good work we may do, let us not claim any praise or\\nbenefit. It is the Lord\\'s; give up the fruits unto Him. Let us stand\\naside and think that we are only servants obeying the Lord, our\\nMaster, and that every impulse for action comes from Him every\\nmoment. Whatever thou worshippest, whatever thou perceivest,\\nwhatever thou doest, give up all unto Him and be at rest. Let us be\\nat peace, perfect peace, with ourselves, and give up our whole\\nbody and mind and everything as an eternal sacrifice unto the\\nLord. Instead of the sacrifice of pouring oblations into the fire,\\nperform this one great sacrifice day and night--the sacrifice of\\nyour little self. \"In search of wealth in this world, Thou art the\\nonly wealth I have found; I sacrifice myself unto Thee. In search\\nof some one to be loved, Thou art the only one beloved I have\\nfound; I sacrifice myself unto Thee.\" Let us repeat this day and\\nnight, and say, \"Nothing for me; no matter whether the thing is\\ngood, bad, or indifferent; I do not care for it; I sacrifice all unto\\nThee.\" Day and night let us renounce our seeming self until it\\nbecomes a habit with us to do so, until it gets into the blood, the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (73 of', 'nerves, and the brain, and the whole body is every moment\\nobedient to this idea of self-renunciation. Go then into the midst of\\nthe battlefield, with the roaring cannon and the din of war, and\\nyou will find yourself to be free and at peace.\\nKarma-Yoga teaches us that the ordinary idea of duty is on the\\nlower plane; nevertheless, all of us have to do our duty. Yet we\\nmay see that this peculiar sense of duty is very often a great cause\\nof misery. Duty becomes a disease with us; it drags us ever\\nforward. It catches hold of us and makes our whole life miserable.\\nIt is the bane of human life. This duty, this idea of duty is the\\nmidday summer sun which scorches the innermost soul of\\nmankind. Look at those poor slaves to duty! Duty leaves them no\\ntime to say prayers, no time to bathe. Duty is ever on them. They\\ngo out and work. Duty is on them! They come home and think of\\nthe work for the next day. Duty is on them! It is living a slave\\'s\\nlife, at last dropping down in the street and dying in harness, like a\\nhorse. This is duty as it is understood. The only true duty is to be\\nunattached and to work as free beings, to give up all work unto\\nGod. All our duties are His. Blessed are we that we are ordered\\nout here. We serve our time; whether we do it ill or well, who\\nknows? If we do it well, we do not get the fruits. If we do it ill,\\nneither do we get the care. Be at rest, be free, and work. This kind\\nof freedom is a very hard thing to attain. How easy it is to interpret\\nslavery as duty--the morbid attachment of flesh for flesh as duty!\\nMen go out into the world and struggle and fight for money or for\\nany other thing to which they get attached. Ask them why they do\\nit. They say, \"It is a duty.\" It is the absurd greed for gold and gain,\\nand they try to cover it with a few flowers.\\nWhat is duty after all? It is really the impulsion of the flesh, of our\\nattachment; and when an attachment has become established, we\\ncall it duty. For instance, in countries where there is no marriage,\\nthere is no duty between husband and wife; when marriage comes,\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (74 of', \"husband and wife live together on account of attachment; and that\\nkind of living together becomes settled after generations; and\\nwhen it becomes so settled, it becomes a duty. It is, so to say, a\\nsort of chronic disease. When it is acute, we call it disease; when it\\nis chronic, we call it nature. It is a disease. So when attachment\\nbecomes chronic, we baptise it with the high-sounding name of\\nduty. We strew flowers upon it, trumpets sound for it, sacred texts\\nare said over it, and then the whole world fights, and men\\nearnestly rob each other for this duty's sake. Duty is good to the\\nextent that it checks brutality. To the lowest kinds of men, who\\ncannot have any other ideal, it is of some good; but those who\\nwant to be Karma Yogis must throw this idea of duty overboard.\\nThere is no duty for you and me. Whatever you have to give to the\\nworld, do give by all means, but not as a duty. Do not take any\\nthought of that. Be not compelled. Why should you be compelled?\\nEverything that you do under compulsion goes to build up\\nattachment. Why should you have any duty? Resign everything\\nunto God. In this tremendous fiery furnace where the fire of duty\\nscorches everybody, drink this cup of nectar and be happy. We are\\nall simply working out His will, and have nothing to do with\\nrewards and punishments. If you want the reward, you must also\\nhave the punishment; the only way to get out of the punishment is\\nto give up the reward. The only way of getting out of misery is by\\ngiving up the idea of happiness, because these two are linked to\\neach other. On one side there is happiness, on the other there is\\nmisery. On one side there is life, on the other there is death. The\\nonly way to get beyond death is to give up the love of life. Life\\nand death are the same thing, looked at from different points. So\\nthe idea of happiness without misery, or of life without death, is\\nvery good for school-boys and children; but the thinker sees that it\\nis all a contradiction in terms and gives up both. Seek no praise,\\nno reward, for anything you do. No sooner do we perform a good\\naction than we begin to desire credit for it. No sooner do we give\\nmoney to some charity than we want to see our names blazoned in\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (75 of\", \"the papers. Misery must come as a result of such desires. The\\ngreatest men in the world have passed away unknown.

Hundreds of these unknown heroes have lived in every\\ncountry working silently.

In the\\nlife of Gautama Buddha we notice him constantly saying that he is\\nthe twenty-fifth Buddha. The twenty-four before him are unknown\\nto history, although the Buddha known to history must have built\\nupon foundations laid by them. The highest men are calm, silent,\\nand unknown.

They will enter deep into human\\nhearts and brains and raise up men and women who will give them\\npractical expression in the workings of human life. These Sattvika\\nmen are too near the Lord to be active and to fight, to be working,\\nstruggling, preaching, and doing good, as they say, here on earth\\nto humanity. The active workers, however good, have still a little\\nremnant of ignorance left in them. When our nature has yet some\\nimpurities left in it, then alone can we work. It is in the nature of\\nwork to be impelled ordinarily by motive and by attachment. In\\nthe presence of an ever active Providence who notes even the\\nsparrow\\'s fall, how can man attach any importance to his own\\nwork? Will it not be a blasphemy to do so when we know that He\\nis taking care of the minutest things in the world? We have only to\\nstand in awe and reverence before Him saying, \"Thy will be\\ndone\". The highest men cannot work, for in them there is no\\nattachment. Those whose whole soul is gone into the Self, those\\nwhose desires are confined in the Self, who have become ever\\nassociated with the Self, for them there is no work. Such are\\nindeed the highest of mankind; but apart from them every one else\\nhas to work. In so working we should never think that we can help\\non even the least thing in this universe. We cannot. We only help\\nourselves in this gymnasium of the world. This is the proper\\nattitude of work. If we work in this way, if we always remember\\nthat our present opportunity to work thus is a privilege which has\\nbeen given to us, we shall never be attached to anything.\\nMillions like you and me think that we are great people in the\\nworld; but we all die, and in five minutes the world forgets us. But\\nthe life of God is infinite. \"Who can live a moment, breathe a\\nmoment, if this all-powerful One does not will it?\" He is the ever\\nactive Providence.

The bonds of the heart will thus break, and we shall\\nreap perfect freedom. This freedom is indeed the goal of Karma-\\nYoga.\\nCHAPTER 8\\nThe ideal of Karma-Yoga\\nThe grandest idea in the religion of the Vedanta is that we may\\nreach the same goal by different paths; and these paths I have\\ngeneralised into four, viz. those of work, love, psychology, and\\nknowledge. But you must, at the same time, remember that these\\ndivisions are not very marked and quite exclusive of each other.\\nEach blends into the other. But according to the type which\\nprevails, we name the divisions. It is not that you can find men\\nwho have no other faculty than that of work, nor that you can find\\nmen who are no more than devoted worshippers only, nor that\\nthere are men who have no more than mere knowledge. These\\ndivisions are made in accordance with the type or the tendency\\nthat may be seen to prevail in a man. We have found that, in the\\nend, all these four paths converge and become one. All religions\\nand all methods of work and worship lead us to one and the same\\ngoal. I have already tried to point out that goal. It is freedom as I\\nunderstand it. Everything that we perceive around us is struggling\\ntowards freedom, from the atom to the man, from the insentient,\\nlifeless particle of matter to the highest existence on earth, the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (78 of', 'human soul. The whole universe is in fact the result of this\\nstruggle for freedom. In all combinations every particle is trying to\\ngo on its own way, to fly from the other particles; but the others\\nare holding it in check. Our earth is trying to fly away from the\\nsun, and the moon from the earth. Everything has a tendency to\\ninfinite dispersion. All that we see in the universe has for its basis\\nthis one struggle towards freedom; it is under the impulse of this\\ntendency that the saint prays and the robber robs. When the line of\\naction taken is not a proper one, we call it evil; and when the\\nmanifestation of it is proper and high, we call it good. But the\\nimpulse is the same, the struggle towards freedom. The saint is\\noppressed with the knowledge of his condition of bondage, and he\\nwants to get rid of it; so he worships God. The thief is oppressed\\nwith the idea that he does not possess certain things, and he tries\\nto get rid of that want, to obtain freedom from it; so he steals.\\nFreedom is the one goal of all nature, sentient or insentient; and\\nconsciously or unconsciously, everything is struggling towards\\nthat goal. The freedom which the saint seeks is very different from\\nthat which the robber seeks; the freedom loved by the saint leads\\nhim to the enjoyment of infinite, unspeakable bliss, while that on\\nwhich the robber has set his heart only forges other bonds for his\\nsoul.\\nThere is to be found in every religion the manifestation of this\\nstruggle towards freedom. It is the groundwork of all morality, of\\nunselfishness, which means getting rid of the idea that men are the\\nsame as their little body. When we see a man doing good work,\\nhelping others, it means that he cannot be confined within the\\nlimited circle of \"me and mine\". There is no limit to this getting\\nout of selfishness. All the great systems of ethics preach absolute\\nunselfishness as the goal. Supposing this absolute unselfishness\\ncan be reached by a man, what becomes of him? He is no more the\\nlittle Mr. So-and-so; he has acquired infinite expansion. The little\\npersonality which he had before is now lost to him for ever; he has\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (79 of', 'become infinite, and the attainment of this infinite expansion is\\nindeed the goal of all religions and of all moral and philosophical\\nteachings. The personalist, when he hears this idea philosophically\\nput, gets frightened. At the same time, if he preaches morality, he\\nafter all teaches the very same idea himself. He puts no limit to the\\nunselfishness of man. Suppose a man becomes perfectly unselfish\\nunder the personalistic system, how are we to distinguish him\\nfrom the perfected ones in other systems? He has become one with\\nthe universe and to become that is the goal of all; only the poor\\npersonalist has not the courage to follow out his own reasoning to\\nits right conclusion. Karma-Yoga is the attaining through unselfish\\nwork of that freedom which is the goal of all human nature. Every\\nselfish action, therefore, retards our reaching the goal, and every\\nunselfish action takes us towards the goal; that is why the only\\ndefinition that can be given of morality is this: That which is\\nselfish is immoral, and that which is unselfish is moral.\\nBut, if you come to details, the matter will not be seen to be quite\\nso simple. For instance, environment often makes the details\\ndifferent as I have already mentioned. The same action under one\\nset of circumstances may be unselfish, and under another set quite\\nselfish. So we can give only a general definition, and leave the\\ndetails to be worked out by taking into consideration the\\ndifferences in time, place, and circumstances. In one country one\\nkind of conduct is considered moral, and in another the very same\\nis immoral, because the circumstances differ. The goal of all\\nnature is freedom, and freedom is to be attained only by perfect\\nunselfishness; every thought, word, or deed that is unselfish takes\\nus towards the goal, and, as such, is called moral. That definition,\\nyou will find, holds good in every religion and every system of\\nethics. In some systems of thought morality is derived from a\\nSuperior Being--God. If you ask why a man ought to do this and\\nnot that, their answer is : \"Because such is the command of God.\"\\nBut whatever be the source from which it is derived, their code of\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (80 of', 'ethics also has the same central idea--not to think of self but to\\ngive up self. And yet some persons, in spite of this high ethical\\nidea, are frightened at the thought of having to give up their little\\npersonalities. We may ask the man who clings to the idea of little\\npersonalities to consider the case of a person who has become\\nperfectly unselfish, who has no thought for himself, who does no\\ndeed for himself, who speaks no word for himself, and then say\\nwhere his \"himself\" is. That \"himself\" is known to him only so\\nlong as he thinks, acts, or speaks for himself. If he is only\\nconscious of others, of the universe, and of the all, where is his\\n\"himself\"? It is gone forever.\\nKarma-Yoga, therefore, is a system of ethics and religion intended\\nto attain freedom through unselfishness, and by good works. The\\nKarma-Yogi need not believe in any doctrine whatever. He may\\nnot believe even in God, may not ask what his soul is, nor think of\\nany metaphysical speculation. He has got his own special aim of\\nrealising selflessness; and he has to work it out himself. Every\\nmoment of his life must be realisation, because he has to solve by\\nmere work, without the help of doctrine or theory, the very same\\nproblem to which the Jnani applies his reason and inspiration and\\nthe Bhakta his love.\\nNow comes the next question: What is this work? What is this\\ndoing good to the world? Can we do good to the world? In an\\nabsolute sense, no; in a relative sense, yes. No permanent or\\neverlasting good can be done to the world; if it could be done, the\\nworld would not be this world. We may satisfy the hunger of a\\nman for five minutes, but he will be hungry again. Every pleasure\\nwith which we supply a man may be seen to be momentary. No\\none can permanently cure this ever-recurring fever of pleasure and\\npain. Can any permanent happiness be given to the world? In the\\nocean we cannot raise a wave without causing a hollow\\nsomewhere else. The sum total of the good things in the world has\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (81 of', \"been the same throughout in its relation to man's need and greed.\\nIt cannot be increased or decreased.

Are not some rich, some poor, some high,\\nsome low, some healthy, some unhealthy? All this was just the\\nsame with the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans in ancient\\ntimes as it is with the Americans today. So far as history is known,\\nit has always been the same; yet at the same time we find that,\\nrunning along with all these incurable differences of pleasure and\\npain, there has ever been the struggle to alleviate them. Every\\nperiod of history has given birth to thousands of men and women\\nwho have worked hard to smooth the passage of life for others.\\nAnd how far have they succeeded? We can only play at driving\\nthe ball from one place to another. We take away pain from the\\nphysical plane, and it goes to the mental one.

The sum total of the energies of pleasure and pain\\ndisplayed here on earth will be the same throughout. We just push\\nit from this side to the other side, and from that side to this, but it\\nwill remain the same, because to remain so is its very nature. This\\nebb and flow, this rising and falling, is in the world's very nature;\\nit would be as logical to hold otherwise as to say that we may have\\nlife without death. This is complete nonsense, because the very\\nidea of life implies death and the very idea of pleasure implies\\npain. The lamp is constantly burning out, and that is its life.

These millennium\\nideas have been great motive powers to work. Many religions\\npreach this an an element in them--that God is coming to rule the\\nuniverse, and that then there will be no difference at all in\\nconditions. The people who preach this doctrine are mere fanatics,\\nand fanatics are indeed the sincerest of mankind. Christianity was\\npreached just on the basis of the fascination of this fanaticism, and\\nthat is what made it so attractive to the Greek and the Roman\\nslaves. They believed that under the millennial religion there\\nwould be no more slavery, that there would be plenty to eat and\\ndrink; and, therefore, they flocked round the Christian standard.\\nThose who preached the idea first were of course ignorant\\nfanatics, but very sincere. In modern times this millennial\\naspiration takes the form of equality--of liberty, equality, and\\nfraternity. This is also fanaticism. True equality has never been\\nand never can be on earth. How can we all be equal here? This\\nimpossible kind of equality implies total death. What makes this\\nworld what it is? Lost balance. In the primal state, which is called\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (83 of', 'chaos, there is perfect balance. How do all the formative forces of\\nthe universe come then?

Again a\\ndisturbance comes, and again we have combination and creation.\\nInequality is the very basis of creation. At the same time the forces\\nstruggling to obtain equality are as much a necessity of creation as\\nthose which destroy it.\\nAbsolute equality, that which means a perfect balance of all the\\nstruggling forces in all the planes, can never be in this world.\\nBefore you attain that state, the world will have become quite\\nunfit for any kind of life, and no one will be there. We find,\\ntherefore, that all these ideas of the millennium and of absolute\\nequality are not only impossible but also that, if we try to carry\\nthem out, they will lead us surely enough to the day of destruction.\\nWhat makes the difference between man and man? It is largely the\\ndifference in the brain. Nowadays no one but a lunatic will say\\nthat we are all born with the same brain power. We come into the\\nworld with unequal endowments; we come as greater men or as\\nlesser men, and there is no getting away from that pre-natally\\ndetermined condition. The American Indians were in this country\\nfor thousands of years, and a few handfuls of your ancestors came\\nto their land. What difference they have caused in the appearance\\nof the country! Why did not the Indians make improvements and\\nbuild cities, if all were equal? With your ancestors a different sort\\nof brain power came into the land, different bundles of past\\nimpressions came, and they worked out and manifested\\nthemselves. Absolute non-differentiation is death. So long as this\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (84 of', \"world lasts, differentiation there will and must be, and the\\nmillennium of perfect equality will come only when a cycle of\\ncreation comes to its end. Before that, equality cannot be. Yet this\\nidea of realising the millennium is a great motive power. Just as\\ninequality is necessary for creation itself, so the struggle to limit it\\nis also necessary. If there were no struggle to become free and get\\nback to God, there would be no creation either. It is the difference\\nbetween these two forces that determines the nature of the motives\\nof men.

There are only two ways out of it; one is to give\\nup all concerns with the machine, to let it go and stand aside, to\\ngive up our desires. That is very easy to say, but is almost\\nimpossible to do. I do not know whether in twenty millions of men\\none can do that. The other way is to plunge into the world and\\nlearn the secret of work, and that is the way of Karma-Yoga. Do\\nnot fly away from the wheels of the world-machine, but stand\\ninside it and learn the secret of work. Through proper work done\\ninside, it is also possible to come out.

When the idea of doing good\\nbecomes a part of his very being, then he will not seek for any\\nmotive outside. Let us do good because it is good to do good; he\\nwho does good work even in order to get to heaven binds himself\\ndown, says the Karma Yogi. Any work that is done with any the\\nleast selfish motive, instead of making us free, forges one more\\nchain for our feet.\\nSo the only way is to give up all the fruits of work, to be\\nunattached to them. Know that this world is not we, nor are we\\nthis world; that we are really not the body; that we really do not\\nwork. We are the Self, eternally at rest and at peace. Why should\\nwe be bound by anything? It is very good to say that we should be\\nperfectly non-attached, but what is the way to do it? Every good\\nwork we do without any ulterior motive, instead of forging a new\\nchain, will break one of the links in the existing chains. Every\\ngood thought that we send to the world without thinking of any\\nreturn, will be stored up there and break one link in the chain, and\\nmake us purer and purer, until we become the purest of mortals.\\nYet all this may seem to be rather quixotic and too philosophical,\\nmore theoretical than practical.

The classes were\\nfree of charge. Generally the Swami held two classes daily- morning\\nand evening.\\nAlthough the Swami delivered many lectures and held numerous classes\\nin the two years and five months he had been in America, these lectures\\nconstituted a departure in the way they were recorded. Just prior to the\\ncommencement of his Winter -95-96 season in NYC, his friends and\\nsupporters aided him by advertising for and ultimately hiring a\\nprofessional stenographer: The man selected, Joseph Josiah Goodwin,\\nlater became a disciple of the Swami and followed him to England andGoodwin's transcriptions of the Swami's lectures form the basis of five\\nbooks.\\nCHAPTER 1\\nKarma in its effect on\\ncharacter\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (2 of\", 'The word Karma is derived from the Sanskrit Kri, to do; all action\\nis Karma. Technically, this word also means the effects of actions.\\nIn connection with metaphysics, it sometimes means the effects,\\nof which our past actions were the causes. But in Karma-Yoga we\\nhave simply to do with the word Karma as meaning work. The\\ngoal of mankind is knowledge. That is the one ideal placed before\\nus by Eastern philosophy. Pleasure is not the goal of man, but\\nknowledge. Pleasure and happiness come to an end. It is a mistake\\nto suppose that pleasure is the goal. The cause of all the miseries\\nwe have in the world is that men foolishly think pleasure to be the\\nideal to strive for. After a time man finds that it is not happiness,\\nbut knowledge, towards which he is going, and that both pleasure\\nand pain are great teachers, and that he learns as much from evil\\nas from good. As pleasure and pain pass before his soul they have\\nupon it different pictures, and the result of these combined\\nimpressions is what is called man\\'s \"character\". If you take the\\ncharacter of any man, it really is but the aggregate of tendencies,\\nthe sum total of the bent of his mind; you will find that misery and\\nhappiness are equal factors in the formation of that character.\\nGood and evil have an equal share in moulding character, and in\\nsome instances misery is a greater teacher than happiness. In\\nstudying the great characters the world has produced, I dare say, in\\nthe vast majority of cases, it would be found that it was misery\\nthat taught more than happiness, it was poverty that taught more\\nthan wealth, it was blows that brought out their inner fire more\\nthan praise.\\nNow this knowledge, again, is inherent in man. No knowledge\\ncomes from outside; it is all inside. What we say a man \"knows\",\\nshould, in strict psychological language, be what he \"discovers\" or\\n\"unveils\"; what a man \"learns\" is really what he \"discovers\", by\\ntaking the cover off his own soul, which is a mine of infinite\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (3 of', 'knowledge.\\nWe say Newton discovered gravitation. Was it sitting anywhere in\\na corner waiting for him? It was in his own mind; the time came\\nand he found it out. All knowledge that the world has ever\\nreceived comes from the mind; the infinite library of the universe\\nis in your own mind. The external world is simply the suggestion,\\nthe occasion, which sets you to study your own mind, but the\\nobject of your study is always your own mind. The falling of an\\napple gave the suggestion to Newton, and he studied his own\\nmind. He rearranged all the previous links of thought in his mind\\nand discovered a new link among them, which we call the law of\\ngravitation. It was not in the apple nor in anything in the centre of\\nthe earth.\\nAll knowledge, therefore, secular or spiritual, is in the human\\nmind. In many cases it is not discovered, but remains covered, and\\nwhen the covering is being slowly taken off, we say, \"We are\\nlearning,\" and the advance of knowledge is made by the advance\\nof this process of uncovering. The man from whom this veil is\\nbeing lifted is the more knowing man, the man upon whom it lies\\nthick is ignorant, and the man from whom it has entirely gone is\\nall-knowing, omniscient. There have been omniscient men, and, I\\nbelieve, there will be yet; and that there will be myriads of them in\\nthe cycles to come. Like fire in a piece of flint, knowledge exists\\nin the mind; suggestion is the friction which brings it out. So with\\nall our feelings and actions--our tears and our smiles, our joys and\\nour griefs, our weeping and our laughter, our curses and our\\nblessings, our praises and our blames--every one of these we may\\nfind, if we calmly study our own selves, to have been brought out\\nfrom within ourselves by so many blows. The result is what we\\nare. All these blows taken together are called Karma--work,\\naction. Every mental and physical blow that is given to the soul,\\nby which, as it were, fire is struck from it, and by which its own\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (4 of', 'power and knowledge are discovered, is Karma, this word being\\nused in its widest sense. Thus we are all doing Karma all the time.\\nI am talking to you: that is Karma. You are listening: that is\\nKarma. We breathe: that is Karma. We walk: Karma. Everything\\nwe do, physical or mental, is Karma, and it leaves its marks on us.\\nThere are certain works which are, as it were, the aggregate, the\\nsum total, of a large number of smaller works. If we stand near the\\nseashore and hear the waves dashing against the shingle, we think\\nit is such a great noise, and yet we know that one wave is really\\ncomposed of millions and millions of minute waves. Each one of\\nthese is making a noise, and yet we do not catch it; it is only when\\nthey become the big aggregate that we hear. Similarly, every\\npulsation of the heart is work. Certain kinds of work we feel and\\nthey become tangible to us; they are, at the same time, the\\naggregate of a number of small works. If you really want to judge\\nof the character of a man, look not at his great performances.\\nEvery fool may become a hero at one time or another. Watch a\\nman do his most common actions; those are indeed the things\\nwhich will tell you the real character of a great man. Great\\noccasions rouse even the lowest of human beings to some kind of\\ngreatness, but he alone is the really great man whose character is\\ngreat always, the same wherever he be.\\nKarma in its effect on character is the most tremendous power\\nthan man has to deal with. Man is, as it were, a centre, and is\\nattracting all the powers of the universe towards himself, and in\\nthis centre is fusing them all and again sending them off in a big\\ncurrent. Such a centre is the real man--the almighty, the\\nomniscient--and he draws the whole universe towards him. Good\\nand bad, misery and happiness, all are running towards him and\\nclinging round him; and out of them he fashions the mighty stream\\nof tendency called character and throws it outwards. As he has the\\npower of drawing in anything, so has he the power of throwing it\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (5 of', \"out.\\nAll the actions that we see in the world, all the movements in\\nhuman society, all the works that we have around us, are simply\\nthe display of thought, the manifestation of the will of man.\\nMachines or instruments, cities, ships, or men-of-war, all these are\\nsimply the manifestation of the will of man; and this will is caused\\nby character, and character is manufactured by Karma. As is\\nKarma, so is the manifestation of the will. The men of mighty will\\nthe world has produced have all been tremendous workers--\\ngigantic souls, with wills powerful enough to overturn worlds,\\nwills they got by persistent work, through ages, and ages. Such a\\ngigantic will as that of a Buddha or a Jesus could not be obtained\\nin one life, for we know who their fathers were. It is not known\\nthat their fathers ever spoke a word for the good of mankind.\\nMillions and millions of carpenters like Joseph had gone; millions\\nare still living. Millions and millions of petty kings like Buddha's\\nfather had been in the world. If it was only a case of hereditary\\ntransmission, how do you account for this petty prince, who was\\nnot, perhaps, obeyed by his own servants, producing this son,\\nwhom half a world worships? How do you explain the gulf\\nbetween the carpenter and his son, whom millions of human\\nbeings worship as God? It cannot be solved by the theory of\\nheredity. The gigantic will which Buddha and Jesus threw over the\\nworld, whence did it come? Whence came this accumulation of\\npower? It must have been there through ages and ages, continually\\ngrowing bigger and\\nbigger, until it burst on society in a Buddha or a Jesus, even\\nrolling down to the present day.\\nAll this is determined by Karma, work. No one can get anything\\nunless he earns it. This is an eternal law. We may sometimes think\\nit is not so, but in the long run we become convinced of it. A man\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (6 of\", 'may struggle all his life for riches; he may cheat thousands, but he\\nfinds at last that he did not deserve to become rich, and his life\\nbecomes a trouble and a nuisance to him. We may go on\\naccumulating things for our physical enjoyment, but only what we\\nearn is really ours. A fool may buy all the books in the world, and\\nthey will be in his library; but he will be able to read only those\\nthat he deserves to; and this deserving is produced by Karma. Our\\nKarma determines what we deserve and what we can assimilate.\\nWe are responsible for what we are; and whatever we wish\\nourselves to be, we have the power to make ourselves. If what we\\nare now has been the result of our own past actions, it certainly\\nfollows that whatever we wish to be in future can be produced by\\nour present actions; so we have to know how to act. You will say,\\n\"What is the use of learning how to work? Everyone works in\\nsome way or other in this world.\" But there is such a thing as\\nfrittering away our energies. With regard to Karma-Yoga, the Gita\\nsays that it is doing work with cleverness and as a science; by\\nknowing how to work, one can obtain the greatest results. You\\nmust remember that all work is simply to bring out the power of\\nthe mind which is already there, to wake up the soul. The power is\\ninside every man, so is knowing; the different works are like\\nblows to bring them out, to cause these giants to wake up.\\nMan works with various motives. There cannot be work without\\nmotive. Some people want to get fame, and they work for fame.\\nOthers want money, and they work for money. Others want to\\nhave power, and they work for power. Others want to get to\\nheaven, and they work for the same. Others want to leave a name\\nwhen they die, as they do in China, where no man gets a title until\\nhe is dead; and that is a better way, after all, than with us. When a\\nman does something very good there, they give a title of nobility\\nto his father, who is dead, or to his grandfather. Some people work\\nfor that. Some of the followers of certain Mohammedan sects\\nwork all their lives to have a big tomb built for them when they\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Selv...ivekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (7 of', \"die. I know sects among whom, as soon as a child is born, a tomb\\nis prepared for it; that is among them the most important work a\\nman has to do, and the bigger and the finer the tomb, the better off\\nthe man is supposed to be. Others work as a penance; do all sorts\\nof wicked things, then erect a temple, or give something to the\\npriests to buy them off and obtain from them a passport to heaven.\\nThey think that this kind of beneficence will clear them and they\\nwill go scot-free in spite of their sinfulness. Such are some of the\\nvarious motives for work.\\nWork for work's sake. There are some who are really the salt of\\nthe earth in every country and who work for work's sake, who do\\nnot care for name, or fame, or even to go to heaven. They work\\njust because good will come of it. There are others who do good to\\nthe poor and help mankind from still higher motives, because they\\nbelieve in doing good and love good. The motive for name and\\nfame seldom brings immediate results, as a rule; they come to us\\nwhen we are old and have almost done with life. If a man works\\nwithout any selfish motive in view, does he not gain anything?\\nYes, he gains the highest. Unselfishness is more paying, only\\npeople have not the patience to practise it. It is more paying from\\nthe point of view of health also. Love, truth and unselfishness are\\nnot merely moral figures of speech, but they form our highest\\nideal, because in them lies such a manifestation of power.

These as\\nmanifested in the physical world are what we may call\\nequilibrium, activity, and inertness. Tamas is typified as darkness\\nor inactivity; Rajas is activity, expressed as attraction or repulsion;\\nand Sattva is the equilibrium of the two. In every man there are\\nthese three forces. Sometimes Tamas prevails. We become lazy,\\nwe cannot move, we are inactive, bound down by certain ideas or\\nby mere dullness. At other times activity prevails, and at still other\\ntimes that calm balancing of both. Again, in different men, one of\\nthese forces is generally predominant. The characteristic of one\\nman is inactivity, dullness and laziness; that of another, activity,\\npower, manifestation of energy; and in still another we find the\\nsweetness, calmness, and gentleness, which are due to the\\nbalancing of both action and inaction. So in all creation--in\\nanimals, plants, and men--we find the more or less typical\\nmanifestation of all these different forces.\\nKarma-Yoga has specially to deal with these three factors. By\\nteaching what they are and how to employ them, it helps us to do\\nour work better. Human society is a graded organisation. We all\\nknow about morality, and we all know about duty, but at the same\\ntime we find that in different countries the significance of\\nmorality varies greatly. What is regarded as moral in one country\\nmay in another be considered perfectly immoral. For instance, in\\none country cousins may marry; in another, it is thought to be very\\nimmoral; in one, men may marry their sisters-in-law; in another, it\\nis regarded as immoral; in one country people may marry only\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (11 of', 'once; in another, many times; and so forth. Similarly, in all other\\ndepartments of morality, we find the standard varies greatly- yet\\nwe have the idea that there must be a universal standard of\\nmorality.\\nSo it is with duty. The idea of duty varies much among different\\nnations. In one country, if a man does not do certain things, people\\nwill say he has acted wrongly; while if he does those very things\\nin another country, people will say that he did not act rightly--and\\nyet we know that there must be some universal idea of duty. In the\\nsame way, one class of society thinks that certain things are\\namong its duty, while another class thinks quite the opposite and\\nwould be horrified if it had to do those things. Two ways are left\\nopen to us--the way of the ignorant, who think that there is only\\none way to truth and that all the rest are wrong, and the way of the\\nwise, who admit that, according to our mental constitution or the\\ndifferent planes of existence in which we are, duty and morality\\nmay vary. The important thing is to know that there are gradations\\nof duty and of morality--that the duty of one state of life, in one\\nset of circumstances, will not and cannot be that of another.\\nTo illustrate: All great teachers have taught, \"Resist not evil,\" that\\nnon-resistance is the highest moral ideal. We all know that, if a\\ncertain number of us attempted to put that maxim fully into\\npractice, the whole social fabric would fall to pieces, the wicked\\nwould take possession of our properties and our lives, and would\\ndo whatever they like with us. Even if only one day of such non-\\nresistance were practised, it would lead to disaster. Yet,\\nintuitively, in our heart of hearts we feel the truth of the teaching\\n\"Resist not evil.\" This seems to us to be the highest ideal; yet to\\nteach this doctrine only would be equivalent to condemning a vast\\nportion of mankind. Not only so, it would be making men feel that\\nthey were always doing wrong, and cause in them scruples of\\nconscience in all their actions; it would weaken them, and that\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (12 of', 'constant self-disapproval would breed more vice than any other\\nweakness would. To the man who has begun to hate himself the\\ngate to degeneration has already opened; and the same is true of a\\nnation. Our first duty is not to hate ourselves, because to advance\\nwe must have faith in ourselves first and then in God. He who has\\nno faith in himself can never have faith in God. Therefore, the\\nonly alternative remaining to us is to recognise that duty and\\nmorality vary under different circumstances; not that the man who\\nresists evil is doing what is always and in itself wrong, but that in\\nthe different circumstances in which he is placed it may become\\neven his duty to resist evil.\\nIn reading the Bhagavad-Gita, many of you in Western countries\\nmay have felt astonished at the second chapter, wherein Sri\\nKrishna calls Arjuna a hypocrite and a coward because of his\\nrefusal to fight, or offer resistance, on account of his adversaries\\nbeing his friends and relatives, making the plea that non-resistance\\nwas the highest ideal of love. This is a great lesson for us all to\\nlearn, that in all matters the two extremes are alike. The extreme\\npositive and the extreme negative are always similar. When the\\nvibrations of light are too slow, we do not see them, nor do we see\\nthem when they are too rapid. So with sound; when very low in\\npitch, we do not hear it; when very high, we do not hear it either.\\nOf like nature is the difference between resistance and non-\\nresistance. One man does not resist because he is weak, lazy, and\\ncannot, not because he will not; the other man knows that he can\\nstrike an irresistible blow if he likes; yet he not only does not\\nstrike, but blesses his enemies. The one who from weakness\\nresists not commits a sin, and as such cannot receive any benefit\\nfrom the non-resistance; while the other would commit a sin by\\noffering resistance. Buddha gave up his throne and renounced his\\nposition, that was true renunciation; but there cannot be any\\nquestion of renunciation in the case of a beggar who has nothing\\nto renounce.

Arjuna became a coward at the sight of\\nthe mighty array against him; his \"love\" make him forget his duty\\ntowards his country and king. That is why Sri Krishna told him\\nthat he was a hypocrite; Thou talkest like a wise man, but thy\\nactions betray thee to be a coward; therefore stand up and fight!\\nSuch is the central idea of Karma-Yoga. The Karma-Yogi is the\\nman who understands that the highest ideal is non-resistance, and\\nwho also knows that this non-resistance is the highest\\nmanifestation of power in actual possession, and also what is\\ncalled the resisting of evil is but a step on the way towards the\\nmanifestation of this highest power, namely, non-resistance.\\nBefore reaching this highest ideal, man\\'s duty is to resist evil; let\\nhim work, let him fight, let him strike straight from the shoulder.\\nThen only, when he has gained the power to resist, will non-\\nresistance be a virtue.\\nI once met a man in my country whom I had known before as a\\nvery stupid, dull person, who knew nothing and had not the desire\\nto know anything, and was living the life of a brute.

It is better to tell a lie than to be a brute, or a log of wood.\\nYou are inactive; you have not certainly reached the highest state,\\nwhich is beyond all actions, calm and serene; you are too dull\\neven to do something wicked.\" That was an extreme case, of\\ncourse, and I was joking with him; but what I meant was that a\\nman must be active in order to pass through activity to perfect\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (14 of', 'calmness.\\nInactivity should be avoided by all means.

It is very\\neasy to say, \"Hate nobody, resist not evil,\" but we know what that\\nkind of thing generally means in practice. When the eyes of\\nsociety are turned towards us, we may make a show of non-\\nresistance, but in our hearts it is canker all the time. We feel the\\nutter want of the calm of non-resistance; we feel that it would be\\nbetter for us to resist. If you desire wealth, and know at the same\\ntime that the whole world regards him who aims at wealth as a\\nvery wicked man, you, perhaps, will not dare to plunge into the\\nstruggle for wealth, yet your mind will be running day and night\\nafter money. This is hypocrisy and will serve no purpose.

Just then came a young man, a\\nSannyasin, handsome as if the sun had come down to the earth,\\nand stood in one corner of the assembly, watching what was going\\non. The throne with the princess came near him, and as soon as\\nshe saw the beautiful Sannyasin, she stopped and threw the\\ngarland over him. The young Sannyasin seized the garland and\\nthrew it off, exclaiming, \"What nonsense is this? I am a\\nSannyasin. What is marriage to me?\" The king of that country\\nthought that perhaps this man was poor and so dared not marry the\\nprincess, and said to him, \"With my daughter goes half my\\nkingdom now, and the whole kingdom after my death!\" and put\\nthe garland again on the Sannyasin.

If a man\\'s wants can be\\nremoved for an hour, it is helping him indeed; if his wants can be\\nremoved for a year, it will be more help to him; but if his wants\\ncan be removed for ever, it is surely the greatest help that can be\\ngiven him. Spiritual knowledge is the only thing that can destroy\\nour miseries for ever; any other knowledge satisfies wants only\\nfor a time. It is only with the knowledge of the spirit that the\\nfaculty of want is annihilated for ever; so helping man spiritually\\nis the highest help that can be given to him. He who gives man\\nspiritual knowledge is the greatest benefactor of mankind and as\\nsuch we always find that those were the most powerful of men\\nwho helped man in his spiritual needs, because spirituality is the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (26 of', \"true basis of all our activities in life. A spiritually strong and\\nsound man will be strong in every other respect, if he so wishes.\\nUntil there is spiritual strength in man even physical needs cannot\\nbe well satisfied. Next to spiritual comes intellectual help. The gift\\nof knowledge is a far higher gift than that of food and clothes; it is\\neven higher than giving life to a man, because the real life of man\\nconsists of knowledge. Ignorance is death, knowledge is life. Life\\nis of very little value, if it is a life in the dark, groping through\\nignorance and misery. Next in order comes, of course, helping a\\nman physically. Therefore, in considering the question of helping\\nothers, we must always strive not to commit the mistake of\\nthinking that physical help is the only help that can be given. It is\\nnot only the last but the least, because it cannot bring about\\npermanent satisfaction. The misery that I feel when I am hungry is\\nsatisfied by eating, but hunger returns; my misery can cease only\\nwhen I am satisfied beyond all want. Then hunger will not make\\nme miserable; no distress, no sorrow will be able to move me. So,\\nthat help which tends to make us strong spiritually is the highest,\\nnext to it comes intellectual help, and after that physical help.\\nThe miseries of the world cannot be cured by physical help only.\\nUntil man's nature changes, these physical needs will always\\narise, and miseries will always be felt, and no amount of physical\\nhelp will cure them completely. The only solution of this problem\\nis to make mankind pure. Ignorance is the mother of all the evil\\nand all the misery we see. Let men have light, let them be pure\\nand spiritually strong and educated, then alone will misery cease\\nin the world, not before. We may convert every house in the\\ncountry into a charity asylum, we may fill the land with hospitals,\\nbut the misery of man will still continue to exist until man's\\ncharacter changes.\\nWe read in the Bhagavad Gita again and again that we must all\\nwork incessantly. All work is by nature composed of good and\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (27 of\", 'evil. We cannot do any work which will not do some good\\nsomewhere; there cannot be any work which will not cause some\\nharm somewhere. Every work must necessarily be a mixture of\\ngood and evil; yet we are commanded to work incessantly. Good\\nand evil will both have their results, will produce their Karma.\\nGood action will entail upon us good effect; bad action, bad. But\\ngood and bad are both bondages of the soul. The solution reached\\nin the Gita in regard to this bondage-producing nature of work is\\nthat, if we do not attach ourselves to the work we do, it will not\\nhave any binding effect on our soul. We shall try to understand\\nwhat is meant by this \"non-attachment\" to work.\\nThis is the one central idea in the Gita: work incessantly, but be\\nnot attached to it. Samskara can be translated very nearly by\\n\"inherent tendency\". Using the simile of a lake for the mind, every\\nripple, every wave that rises in the mind, when it subsides, does\\nnot die out entirely, but leaves a mark and a future possibility of\\nthat wave coming out again. This mark, with the possibility of the\\nwave reappearing, is what is called Samskara. Every work that we\\ndo, every movement of the body, every thought that we think,\\nleaves such an impression on the mind-stuff, and even when such\\nimpressions are not obvious on the surface, they are sufficiently\\nstrong to work beneath the surface, subconsciously. What we are\\nevery moment is determined by the sum total of these impressions\\non the mind. What I am just at this moment is the effect of the\\nsum total of all the impressions of my past life. This is really what\\nis meant by character; each man\\'s character is determined by the\\nsum total of these impressions. If good impressions prevail, the\\ncharacter becomes good; if bad, it becomes bad. If a man\\ncontinuously hears bad words, thinks bad thoughts, does bad\\nactions, his mind will be full of bad impressions; and they will\\ninfluence his thought and work without his being conscious of the\\nfact. In fact, these bad impressions are always working, and their\\nresultant must be evil, and that man will be a bad man; he cannot\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (28 of', \"help it. The sum total of these impressions in him will create the\\nstrong motive power for doing bad actions. He will be like a\\nmachine in the hand of his impressions, and they will force him to\\ndo evil. Similarly, if a man thinks good thoughts and does good\\nworks, the sum total of these impressions will be good; and they,\\nin a similar manner, will force him to do good even in spite of\\nhimself. When a man has done so much good work and thought so\\nmany good thoughts that there is an irresistible tendency in him to\\ndo good, in spite of himself and even if he wishes to do evil, his\\nmind, as the sum total of his tendencies, will not allow him to do\\nso; the tendencies will turn him back; he is completely under the\\ninfluence of the good tendencies. When such is the case, a man's\\ngood character is said to be established.\\nAs the tortoise tucks its feet and head inside the shell, and you\\nmay kill it and break it in pieces, and yet it will not come out,\\neven so the character of that man who has control over his\\nmotives and organs is unchangeably established. He controls his\\nown inner forces, and nothing can draw them out against his will.\\nBy this continuous reflex of good thoughts, good impressions\\nmoving over the surface of the mind, the tendency for doing good\\nbecomes strong, and as the result we feel able to control the\\nIndriyas (the sense-organs, the nerve-centres). Thus alone will\\ncharacter be established, then alone a man gets to truth. Such a\\nman is safe for ever; he cannot do any evil. You may place him in\\nany company, there will be no danger for him. There is a still\\nhigher state than having this good tendency, and that is the desire\\nfor liberation. You must remember that freedom of the soul is the\\ngoal of all Yogas, and each one equally leads to the same result.\\nBy work alone men may get to where Buddha got largely by\\nmeditation or Christ by prayer. Buddha was a working Jnani,\\nChrist was a Bhakta, but the same goal was reached by both of\\nthem. The difficulty is here. Liberation means entire freedom--\\nfreedom from the bondage of good, as well as from the bondage\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (29 of\", 'of evil.

There is\\na thorn in my finger, and I use another to take the first one out;\\nand when I have taken it out, I throw both of them aside; I have no\\nnecessity for keeping the second thorn, because both are thorns\\nafter all. So the bad tendencies are to be counteracted by the good\\nones, and the bad impressions on the mind should be removed by\\nthe fresh waves of good ones, until all that is evil almost\\ndisappears, or is subdued and held in control in a corner of the\\nmind; but after that, the good tendencies have also to be\\nconquered. Thus the \"attached\" becomes the \"unattached\". Work,\\nbut let not the action or the thought produce a deep impression on\\nthe mind.

This\\nworld is not our habitation, it is only one of the many stages\\nthrough which we are passing.

If we\\nremember this always, we shall never be attached to nature; we\\nshall know that nature is a book in which we are to read, and that\\nwhen we have gained the required knowledge, the book is of no\\nmore value to us. Instead of that, however, we are identifying\\nourselves with nature; we are thinking that the soul is for nature,\\nthat the spirit is for the flesh, and, as the common saying has it, we\\nthink that man \"lives to eat\" and not \"eats to live\". We are\\ncontinually making this mistake; we are regarding nature as\\nourselves and are becoming attached to it; and as soon as this\\nattachment comes, there is the deep impression on the soul, which\\nbinds us down and makes us work not from freedom but like\\nslaves.\\nThe whole gist of this teaching is that you should work like a\\nmaster and not as a slave; work incessantly, but do not do slave\\'s\\nwork.

This is true of work\\ndone for relatives and friends, and is true of work done for our\\nown selves. Selfish work is slave\\'s work; and here is a test. Every\\nact of love brings happiness; there is no act of love which does not\\nbring peace and blessedness as its reaction. Real existence, real\\nknowledge, and real love are eternally connected with one\\nanother, the three in one: where one of them is, the others also\\nmust be; they are the three aspects of the One without a second--\\nthe Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. When that existence becomes\\nrelative, we see it as the world; that knowledge becomes in its turn\\nmodified into the knowledge of the things of the world; and that\\nbliss forms the foundation of all true love known to the heart of\\nman. Therefore true love can never react so as to cause pain either\\nto the lover or to the beloved. Suppose a man loves a woman; he\\nwishes to have her all to himself and feels extremely jealous about\\nher every movement; he wants her to sit near him, to stand near\\nhim, and to eat and move at his bidding. He is a slave to her and\\nwishes to have her as his slave. That is not love; it is a kind of\\nmorbid affection of the slave, insinuating itself as love. It cannot\\nbe love, because it is painful; if she does not do what he wants, it\\nbrings him pain. With love there is no painful reaction; love only\\nbrings a reaction of bliss; if it does not, it is not love; it is\\nmistaking something else for love.

When I was first learning English, I read an\\nEnglish story book in which there was a story about a dutiful boy\\nwho had gone out to work and had given some of his money to his\\nold mother, and this was praised in three or four pages. What was\\nthat? No Hindu boy can ever understand the moral of that story.\\nNow I understand it when I hear the Western idea--every man for\\nhimself.

The idea of duty again is different in different\\nnations. The Mohammedan says what is written in his book, the\\nKoran, is his duty; the Hindu says what is in the Vedas is his duty;\\nand the Christian says what is in the Bible is his duty. We find that\\nthere are varied ideas of duty, differing according to different\\nstates in life, different historical periods and different nations. The\\nterm \"duty\", like every other universal abstract term, is impossible\\nclearly to define; we can only get an idea of it by knowing its\\npractical operations and results. When certain things occur before\\nus, we have all a natural or trained impulse to act in a certain\\nmanner towards them; when this impulse comes, the mind begins\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (36 of', 'to think about the situation. Sometimes it thinks that it is good to\\nact in a particular manner under the given conditions; at other\\ntimes it thinks that it is wrong to act in the same manner even in\\nthe very same circumstances. The ordinary idea of duty\\neverywhere is that every good man follows the dictates of his\\nconscience. But what is it that makes an act a duty? If a Christian\\nfinds a piece of beef before him and does not eat it to save his own\\nlife, or will not give it to save the life of another man, he is sure to\\nfeel that he has not done his duty. But if a Hindu dares to eat that\\npiece of beef or to give it to another Hindu, he is equally sure to\\nfeel that he too has not done his duty; the Hindu\\'s training and\\neducation make him feel that way. In the last century there were\\nnotorious bands of robbers in India called thugs; they thought it\\ntheir duty to kill any man they could and take away his money; the\\nlarger the number of men they killed, the better they thought they\\nwere. Ordinarily if a man goes out into the street and shoots down\\nanother man, he is apt to feel sorry for it, thinking that he has done\\nwrong. But if the very same man, as a soldier in his regiment, kills\\nnot one but twenty, he is certain to feel glad and think that he has\\ndone his duty remarkable well. Therefore we see that it is not the\\nthing done that defines a duty. To give an objective definition of\\nduty is thus entirely impossible. Yet there is duty from the\\nsubjective side. Any action that makes us go Godward is a good\\naction, and is our duty; any action that makes us go downward is\\nevil, and is not our duty. From the subjective standpoint we may\\nsee that certain acts have a tendency to exalt and ennoble us, while\\ncertain other acts have a tendency to degrade and to brutalise us.\\nBut it is not possible to make out with certainty which acts have\\nwhich kind of tendency in relation to all persons, of all sorts and\\nconditions. There is, however, only one idea of duty which has\\nbeen universally accepted by all mankind, of all ages and sects\\nand countries, and that has been summed up in a Sanskrit\\naphorism thus: \"Do not injure any being; not injuring any being is\\nvirtue, injuring any being is sin.\"\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (37 of', 'The Bhagavad Gita frequently alludes to duties dependent upon\\nbirth and position in life.

It is therefore our duty to do\\nthat work which will exalt and ennoble us in accordance with the\\nideals and activities of the society in which we are born. But it\\nmust be particularly remembered that the same ideals and\\nactivities do not prevail in all societies and countries; our\\nignorance of this is the main cause of much of the hatred of one\\nnation towards another. An American thinks that whatever an\\nAmerican does in accordance with the custom of his country is the\\nbest thing to do, and that whoever does not follow his custom\\nmust be a very wicked man. A Hindu thinks that his customs are\\nthe only right ones and are the best in the world, and that\\nwhosoever does not obey them must be the most wicked man\\nliving. This is quite a natural mistake which all of us are apt to\\nmake. But it is very harmful; it is the cause of half the\\nuncharitableness found in the world. When I came to this country\\nand was going through the Chicago Fair, a man from behind\\npulled at my turban. I looked back and saw that he was a very\\ngentlemanly-looking man, neatly dressed. I spoke to him; and\\nwhen he found that I knew English, he became very much\\nabashed. On another occasion in the same Fair another man gave\\nme a push. When I asked him the reason, he also was ashamed\\nand stammered out an apology saying, \"Why do you dress that\\nway?\" The sympathies of these men were limited within the range\\nof their own language and their own fashion of dress. Much of the\\noppression of powerful nations on weaker ones is caused by this\\nprejudice. It dries up their fellow-feeling for fellow men. That\\nvery man who asked me why I did not dress as he did and wanted\\nto ill-treat me because of my dress may have been a very good\\nman, a good father, and a good citizen; but the kindliness of his\\nnature died out as soon as he saw a man in a different dress.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (38 of', 'Strangers are exploited in all countries, because they do not know\\nhow to defend themselves; thus they carry home false impressions\\nof the peoples they have seen.

They\\ncould not have done this if they had met the good, the kindly sides\\nof Western life.\\nTherefore the one point we ought to remember is that we should\\nalways try to see the duty of others through their own eyes, and\\nnever judge the customs of other peoples by our own standard.

Let us do that duty which is ours by birth; and when\\nwe have done that, let us do the duty which is ours by our position\\nin life and in society. There is, however, one great danger in\\nhuman nature, viz. that man never examines himself. He thinks he\\nis quite as fit to be on the throne as the king. Even if he is, he must\\nfirst show that he has done the duty of his own position; and then\\nhigher duties will come to him. When we begin to work earnestly\\nin the world, nature gives us blows right and left and soon enables\\nus to find out our position.

No man is to be judged by the mere nature\\nof his duties, but all should be judged by the manner and the spirit\\nin which they perform them.\\nLater on we shall find that even this idea of duty undergoes\\nchange, and that the greatest work is done only when there is no\\nselfish motive to prompt it.

This is\\naccomplished by the continuous denial of low desires, which duty\\nrigorously requires. The whole organisation of society has thus\\nbeen developed, consciously or unconsciously, in the realms of\\naction and experience, where, by limiting selfishness, we open the\\nway to an unlimited expansion of the real nature of man.\\nDuty is seldom sweet.

Similarly, every husband must look\\nupon all women, except his own wife, in the light of his own\\nmother or daughter or sister.

Dare you throw these dry leaves upon my head!\"\\nAs with these words he angrily glanced at them, a flash of fire\\nwent out of his head--such was the Yogi\\'s power--and burnt the\\nbirds to ashes. He was very glad, almost overjoyed at this\\ndevelopment of power--he could burn the crow and the crane by a\\nlook. After a time he had to go to the town to beg his bread. He\\nwent, stood at a door, and said, \"Mother, give me food.\" A voice\\ncame from inside the house, \"Wait a little, my son.\" The young\\nman thought, \"You wretched woman, how dare you make me\\nwait! You do not know my power yet.\" While he was thinking\\nthus the voice came again: \"Boy, don\\'t be thinking too much of\\nyourself. Here is neither crow nor crane.\" He was astonished; still\\nhe had to wait. At last the woman came, and he fell at her feet and\\nsaid, \"Mother, how did you know that?\" She said, \"My boy, I do\\nnot know your Yoga or your practices. I am a common everyday\\nwoman.

When he came near the town, he found the market and\\nthere saw, at a distance, a big fat Vyadha cutting meat with big\\nknives, talking and bargaining with different people.

He then washed his old\\nfather and mother, fed them, and did all he could to please them,\\nafter which he came to the Sannyasin and said, \"Now, sir, you\\nhave come here to see me; what can I do for you?\" The Sannyasin\\nasked him a few questions about soul and about God, and the\\nVyadha gave him a lecture which forms a part of the\\nMahabharata, called the Vyadha Gita .

In every\\nreligion there are three parts: philosophy, mythology, and ritual.\\nPhilosophy of course is the essence of every religion; mythology\\nexplains and illustrates it by means of the more or less legendary\\nlives of great men, stories and fables of wonderful things, and so\\non; ritual gives to that philosophy a still more concrete form, so\\nthat every one may grasp it--ritual is in fact concretised\\nphilosophy. This ritual is Karma; it is necessary in every religion,\\nbecause most of us cannot understand abstract spiritual things\\nuntil we grow much spiritually. It is easy for men to think that\\nthey can understand anything; but when it comes to practical\\nexperience, they find that abstract ideas are often very hard to\\ncomprehend. Therefore symbols are of great help, and we cannot\\ndispense with the symbolical method of putting things before us.\\nFrom time immemmorial symbols have been used by all kinds of\\nreligions. In one sense we cannot think but in symbols; words\\nthemselves are symbols of thought. In another sense everything in\\nthe universe may be looked upon as a symbol. The whole universe\\nis a symbol, and God is the essence behind. This kind of\\nsymbology is not simply the creation of man; it is not that certain\\npeople belonging to a religion sit down together and think out\\ncertain symbols, and bring them into existence out of their own\\nminds. The symbols of religion have a natural growth. Otherwise,\\nwhy is it that certain symbols are associated with certain ideas in\\nthe mind of almost every one? Certain symbols are universally\\nprevalent. Many of you may think that the cross first came into\\nexistence as a symbol in connection with the Christian religion,\\nbut as a matter of fact it existed before Christianity was, before\\nMoses was born, before the Vedas were given out, before there\\nwas any human record of human things. The cross may be found\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (45 of', \"to have been in existence among the Aztecs and the Phoenicians;\\nevery race seems to have had the cross. Again, the symbol of the\\ncrucified Savior, of a man crucified upon a cross, appears to have\\nbeen known to almost every nation. The circle has been a great\\nsymbol throughout the world. Then there is the most universal of\\nall symbols, the Swastika. At one time it was thought that the\\nBuddhists carried it all over the world with them, but it has been\\nfound out that ages before Buddhism it was used among nations.\\nIn Old Babylon and in Egypt it was to be found. What does this\\nshow? All these symbols could not have been purely\\nconventional. There must be some reason for them; some natural\\nassociation between them and the human mind. Language is not\\nthe result of convention; it is not that people ever agreed to\\nrepresent certain ideas by certain words; there never was an idea\\nwithout a corresponding word or a word without a corresponding\\nidea; ideas and words are in their nature inseparable. The symbols\\nto represent ideas may be sound symbols or colour symbols. Deaf\\nand dumb people have to think with other than sound symbols.\\nEvery thought in the mind has a form as its counterpart. This is\\ncalled in Sanskrit philosophy Nama-Rupa--name and form. It is as\\nimpossible to create by convention a system of symbols as it is to\\ncreate a language. In the world's ritualistic symbols we have an\\nexpression of the religious thought of humanity. It is easy to say\\nthat there is no use of rituals and temples and all such\\nparaphernalia; every baby says that in modern times. But it must\\nbe easy for all to see that those who worship inside a temple are in\\nmany respects different from those who will not worship there.\\nTherefore the association of particular temples, rituals, and other\\nconcrete forms with particular religions has a tendency to bring\\ninto the minds of the followers of those religions the thoughts for\\nwhich those concrete things stand as symbols; and it is not wise to\\nignore rituals and symbology altogether. The study and practice of\\nthese things form naturally a part of Karma-Yoga.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (46 of\", 'There are many other aspects of this science of work.

In every religion the\\npower of the word is recognised, so much so that in some of them\\ncreation itself is said to have come out of the word. The external\\naspect of the thought of God is the Word, and as God thought and\\nwilled before He created, creation came out of the Word. In this\\nstress and hurry of our materialistic life, our nerves lose\\nsensibility and become hardened. The older we grow, the longer\\nwe are knocked about in the world, the more callous we become;\\nand we are apt to neglect things that even happen persistently and\\nprominently around us.

It is not true that this universe is drifting and\\nstands in need of help from you and me. God is ever present\\ntherein, He is undying and eternally active and infinitely watchful.\\nWhen the whole universe sleeps, He sleeps not; He is working\\nincessantly; all the changes and manifestations of the world are\\nHis. Thirdly, we ought not to hate anyone. This world will always\\ncontinue to be a mixture of good and evil. Our duty is to\\nsympathise with the weak and to love even the wrongdoer. The\\nworld is a grand moral gymnasium wherein we have all to take\\nexercise so as to become stronger and stronger spiritually.\\nFourthly, we ought not to be fanatics of any kind, because\\nfanaticism is opposed to love. You hear fanatics glibly saying, \"I\\ndo not hate the sinner. I hate the sin,\" but I am prepared to go any\\ndistance to see the face of that man who can really make a\\ndistinction between the sin and the sinner. It is easy to say so. If\\nwe can distinguish well between quality and substance, we may\\nbecome perfect men. It is not easy to do this. And further, the\\ncalmer we are and the less disturbed our nerves, the more shall we\\nlove and the better will our work be.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (52 of', 'CHAPTER 6\\nNon-attachment is the\\ncomplete self-abnegation\\nJust as every action that emanates from us comes back to us as\\nreaction, even so our actions may act on other people and theirs\\non us. Perhaps all of you have observed it as a fact that when\\npersons do evil actions, they become more and more evil, and\\nwhen they begin to do good, they become stronger and stronger\\nand learn to do good at all times. This intensification of the\\ninfluence of action cannot be explained on any other ground than\\nthat we can act and react upon each other. To take an illustration\\nfrom physical science, when I am doing a certain action, my mind\\nmay be said to be in a certain state of vibration; all minds which\\nare in similar circumstances will have the tendency to be affected\\nby my mind. If there are different musical instruments tuned alike\\nin one room, all of you may have noticed that when one is struck,\\nthe others have the tendency to vibrate so as to give the same\\nnote. So all minds that have the same tension, so to say, will be\\nequally affected by the same thought. Of course, this influence of\\nthought on mind will vary according to distance and other causes,\\nbut the mind is always open to affection. Suppose I am doing an\\nevil act, my mind is in a certain state of vibration, and all minds in\\nthe universe, which are in a similar state, have the possibility of\\nbeing affected by the vibration of my mind. So, when I am doing\\na good action, my mind is in another state of vibration; and all\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (53 of', 'minds similarly strung have the possibility of being affected by\\nmy mind; and this power of mind upon mind is more or less\\naccording as the force of the tension is greater or less.\\nFollowing this simile further, it is quite possible that, just as light\\nwaves may travel for millions of years before they reach any\\nobject, so thought waves may also travel hundreds of years before\\nthey meet an object with which they vibrate in unison. It is quite\\npossible, therefore, that this atmosphere of ours is full of such\\nthought pulsations, both good and evil. Every thought projected\\nfrom every brain goes on pulsating, as it were, until it meets a fit\\nobject that will receive it. Any mind which is open to receive\\nsome of these impulses will take them immediately. So, when a\\nman is doing evil actions, he has brought his mind to a certain\\nstate of tension and all the waves which correspond to that state of\\ntension, and which may be said to be already in the atmosphere,\\nwill struggle to enter into his mind. That is why an evil-doer\\ngenerally goes on doing more and more evil. His actions become\\nintensified. Such, also will be the case with the doer of good; he\\nwill open himself to all the good waves that are in the atmosphere,\\nand his good actions also will become intensified. We run,\\ntherefore, a twofold danger in doing evil: first, we open ourselves\\nto all the evil influences surrounding us; secondly, we create evil\\nwhich affects others, may be hundreds of years hence. In doing\\nevil we injure ourselves and others also. In doing good we do\\ngood to ourselves and to others as well; and, like all other forces\\nin man, these forces of good and evil also gather strength from\\noutside.\\nAccording to Karma-Yoga, the action one has done cannot be\\ndestroyed until it has borne its fruit; no power in nature can stop it\\nfrom yielding its results. If I do an evil action, I must suffer for it;\\nthere is no power in this universe to stop or stay it. Similarly, if I\\ndo a good action, there is no power in the universe which can stop\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (54 of', \"its bearing good results. The cause must have its effect; nothing\\ncan prevent or restrain this. Now comes a very fine and serious\\nquestion about Karma-Yoga--namely, that these actions of ours,\\nboth good and evil, are intimately connected with each other. We\\ncannot put a line of demarcation and say, this action is entirely\\ngood and this entirely evil. There is no action which does not bear\\ngood and evil fruits at the same time. To take the nearest example:\\nI am talking to you, and some of you, perhaps, think I am doing\\ngood; and at the same time I am, perhaps, killing thousands of\\nmicrobes in the atmosphere; I am thus doing evil to something\\nelse. When it is very near to us and affects those we know, we say\\nthat it is very good action if it affects them in a good manner. For\\ninstance, you may call my speaking to you very good, but the\\nmicrobes will not; the microbes you do not see, but yourselves\\nyou do see. The way in which my talk affects you is obvious to\\nyou, but how it affects the microbes is not so obvious. And so, if\\nwe analyse our evil actions also, we may find that some good\\npossibly results from them somewhere. He who in good action\\nsees that there is something evil in it, and in the midst of evil sees\\nthat there is something good in it somewhere, has known the\\nsecret of work.\\nBut what follows from it? That, howsoever we may try, there\\ncannot be any action which is perfectly pure, or any which is\\nperfectly impure, taking purity and impurity in the sense of injury\\nand non-injury. We cannot breathe or live without injuring others,\\nand every bit of the food we eat is taken away from another's\\nmouth. Our very lives are crowding out other lives. It may be\\nmen, or animals, or small microbes, but some one or other of\\nthese we have to crowd out. That being the case, it naturally\\nfollows that perfection can never be attained by work. We may\\nwork through all eternity, but there will be no way out of this\\nintricate maze. You may work on, and on, and on; there will be no\\nend to this inevitable association of good and evil in the results of\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (55 of\", 'work.\\nThe second point to consider is, what is the end of work? We find\\nthe vast majority of people in every country believing that there\\nwill be a time when this world will become perfect, when there\\nwill be no disease, nor death, nor unhappiness, nor wickedness.\\nThat is a very good idea, a very good motive power to inspire and\\nuplift the ignorant; but if we think for a moment, we shall find on\\nthe very face of it that it cannot be so. How can it be, seeing that\\ngood and evil are the obverse and reverse of the same coin? How\\ncan you have good without evil at the same time? What is meant\\nby perfection? A perfect life is a contradiction in terms. Life itself\\nis a state of continuous struggle between ourselves and everything\\noutside. Every moment we are fighting actually with external\\nnature, and if we are defeated, our life has to go. It is, for instance,\\na continuous struggle for food and air. If food or air fails, we die.\\nLife is not a simple and smoothly flowing thing, but it is a\\ncompound effect. This complex struggle between something\\ninside and the external world is what we call life. So it is clear that\\nwhen this struggle ceases, there will be an end of life.\\nWhat is meant by ideal happiness is the cessation of this struggle.\\nBut then life will cease, for the struggle can only cease when life\\nitself has ceased. We have seen already that in helping the world\\nwe help ourselves. The main effect of work done for others is to\\npurify ourselves. By means of the constant effort to do good to\\nothers we are trying to forget ourselves; this forgetfulness of self\\nis the one great lesson we have to learn in life. Man thinks\\nfoolishly that he can make himself happy, and after years of\\nstruggle finds out at last that true happiness consists in killing\\nselfishness and that no one can make him happy except himself.\\nEvery act of charity, every thought of sympathy, every action of\\nhelp, every good deed, is taking so much of self-importance away\\nfrom our little selves and making us think of ourselves as the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (56 of', 'lowest and the least, and, therefore, it is all good. Here we find\\nthat Jnana, Bhakti, and Karma--all come to one point. The highest\\nideal is eternal and entire self-abnegation, where there is no \"I\",\\nbut all is \"Thou\"; and whether he is conscious or unconscious of\\nit, Karma-Yoga leads man to that end. A religious preacher may\\nbecome horrified at the idea of an Impersonal God; he may insist\\non a Personal God and wish to keep up his own identity and\\nindividuality, whatever he may mean by that. But his ideas of\\nethics, if they are really good, cannot but be based on the highest\\nself-abnegation. It is the basis of all morality; you may extend it to\\nmen, or animals, or angels, it is the one basic idea, the one\\nfundamental principle running through all ethical systems.\\nYou will find various classes of men in this world. First, there are\\nthe God-men, whose self-abnegation is complete, and who do\\nonly good to others even at the sacrifice of their own lives. These\\nare the highest of men. If there are a hundred of such in any\\ncountry, that country need never despair. But they are\\nunfortunately too few. Then there are the good men who do good\\nto others so long as it does not injure themselves. And there is a\\nthird class who, to do good to themselves, injure others. It is said\\nby a Sanskrit poet that there is a fourth unnamable class of people\\nwho injure others merely for injury\\'s sake. Just as there are at one\\npole of existence the highest good men, who do good for the sake\\nof doing good, so, at the other pole, there are others who injure\\nothers just for the sake of the injury. They do not gain anything\\nthereby, but it is their nature to do evil.\\nHere are two Sanskrit words. The one is Pravritti, which means\\nrevolving towards, and the other is Nivritti, which means\\nrevolving away. The \"revolving towards\" is what we call the\\nworld, the \"I and mine\"; it includes all those things which are\\nalways enriching that \"me\" by wealth and money and power, and\\nname and fame, and which are of a grasping nature, always\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (57 of', 'tending to accumulate everything in one centre, that centre being\\n\"myself\". That is the Pravritti, the natural tendency of every\\nhuman being; taking everything from everywhere and heaping it\\naround one centre, that centre being man\\'s own sweet self. When\\nthis tendency begins to break, when it is Nivritti or \"going away\\nfrom,\" then begin morality and religion. Both Pravritti and Nivritti\\nare of the nature of work: the former is evil work, and the latter is\\ngood work. This Nivritti is the fundamental basis of all morality\\nand all religion, and the very perfection of it is entire self-\\nabnegation, readiness to sacrifice mind and body and everything\\nfor another being. When a man has reached that state, he has\\nattained to the perfection of Karma-Yoga. This is the highest\\nresult of good works. Although a man has not studied a single\\nsystem of philosophy, although he does not believe in any God,\\nand never has believed, although he has not prayed even once in\\nhis whole life, if the simple power of good actions has brought\\nhim to that state where he is ready to give up his life and all else\\nfor others, he has arrived at the same point to which the religious\\nman will come through his prayers and the philosopher through\\nhis knowledge; and so you may find that the philosopher, the\\nworker, and the devotee, all meet at one point, that one point\\nbeing self-abnegation. However much their systems of philosophy\\nand religion may differ, all mankind stand in reverence and awe\\nbefore the man who is ready to sacrifice himself for others. Here,\\nit is not at all any question of creed, or doctrine- even men who\\nare very much opposed to all religious ideas, when they see one of\\nthese acts of complete self-sacrifice, feel that they must revere it.\\nHave you not seen even a most bigoted Christian, when he reads\\nEdwin Arnold\\'s Light of Asia, stand in reverence of Buddha, who\\npreached no God, preached nothing but self-sacrifice? The only\\nthing is that the bigot does not know that his own end and aim in\\nlife is exactly the same as that of those from whom he differs. The\\nworshipper, by keeping constantly before him the idea of God and\\na surrounding of good, comes to the same point at last and says,\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (58 of', '\"Thy will be done,\" and keeps nothing to himself. That is self-\\nabnegation. The philosopher, with his knowledge, sees that the\\nseeming self is a delusion and easily gives it up. It is self-\\nabnegation. So Karma, Bhakti, and Jnana all meet here; and this is\\nwhat was meant by all the great preachers of ancient times, when\\nthey taught that God is not the world. There is one thing which is\\nthe world and another which is God; and this distinction is very\\ntrue. What they mean by world is selfishness. Unselfishness is\\nGod. One may live on a throne, in a golden palace, and be\\nperfectly unselfish; and then he is in God. Another may live in a\\nhut and wear rags, and have nothing in the world; yet, if he is\\nselfish, he is intensely merged in the world.\\nTo come back to one of our main points, we say that we cannot do\\ngood without at the same time doing some evil, or do evil without\\ndoing some good. Knowing this, how can we work? There have,\\ntherefore, been sects in this world who have in an astoundingly\\npreposterous way preached slow suicide as the only means to get\\nout of the world, because if a man lives, he has to kill poor little\\nanimals and plants or do injury to something or some one. So\\naccording to them the only way out of the world is to die. The\\nJains have preached this doctrine as their highest ideal. This\\nteaching seems to be very logical. But the true solution is found in\\nthe Gita. It is the theory of non-attachment, to be attached to\\nnothing while doing our work of life. Know that you are separated\\nentirely from the world, though you are in the world, and that\\nwhatever you may be doing in it, you are not doing that for your\\nown sake. Any action that you do for yourself will bring its effect\\nto bear upon you. If it is a good action, you will have to take the\\ngood effect, and if bad, you will have to take the bad effect; but\\nany action that is not done for your own sake, whatever it be, will\\nhave no effect on you. There is to be found a very expressive\\nsentence in our scriptures embodying this idea: \"Even if he kill\\nthe whole universe (or be himself killed), he is neither the killer\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (59 of', 'nor the killed, when he knows that he is not acting for himself at\\nall.\" Therefore Karma-Yoga teaches, \"Do not give up the world;\\nlive in the world, imbibe its influences as much as you can; but if\\nit be for your own enjoyment\\'s sake, work not at all.\" Enjoyment\\nshould not be the goal. First kill your self and then take the whole\\nworld as yourself; as the old Christians used to say, \"The old man\\nmust die.\" This old man is the selfish idea that the whole world is\\nmade for our enjoyment. Foolish parents teach their children to\\npray, \"O Lord, Thou hast created this sun for me and this moon\\nfor me,\" as if the Lord has had nothing else to do than to create\\neverything for these babies. Do not teach your children such\\nnonsense. Then again, there are people who are foolish in another\\nway: they teach us that all these animals were created for us to kill\\nand eat, and that this universe is for the enjoyment of men. That is\\nall foolishness. A tiger may say, \"Man was created for me,\" and\\npray, \"O Lord, how wicked are these men who do not come and\\nplace themselves before me to be eaten; they are breaking Your\\nlaw.\" If the world is created for us, we are also created for the\\nworld. That this world is created for our enjoyment is the most\\nwicked idea that holds us down. This world is not for our sake.\\nMillions pass out of it every year; the world does not feel it;\\nmillions of others are supplied in their place. Just as much as the\\nworld is for us, so we also are for the world. To work properly,\\ntherefore, you have first to give up the idea of attachment.\\nSecondly, do not mix in the fray, hold yourself as a witness and\\ngo on working. My master used to say, \"Look upon your children\\nas a nurse does.\" The nurse will take your baby and fondle it and\\nplay with it and behave towards it as gently as if it were her own\\nchild; but as soon as you give her notice to quit, she is ready to\\nstart off bag and baggage from the house. Everything in the shape\\nof attachment is forgotten; it will not give the ordinary nurse the\\nleast pang to leave your children and take up other children. Even\\nso are you to be with all that you consider your own. You are the\\nnurse, and if you believe in God, believe that all these things\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (60 of', \"which you consider yours are really His. The greatest weakness\\noften insinuates itself as the greatest good and strength. It is a\\nweakness to think that any one is dependent on me, and that I can\\ndo good to another. This belief is the mother of all our attachment,\\nand through this attachment comes all our pain. We must inform\\nour minds that no one in this universe depends upon us; not one\\nbeggar depends on our charity; not one soul on our kindness; not\\none living thing on our help. All are helped on by nature, and will\\nbe so helped even though millions of us were not here. The course\\nof nature will not stop for such as you and me; it is, as already\\npointed out, only a blessed privilege to you and to me that we are\\nallowed, in the way of helping others, to educate ourselves. This\\nis a great lesson to learn in life, and when we have learned it fully,\\nwe shall never be unhappy; we can go and mix without harm in\\nsociety anywhere and everywhere. You may have wives and\\nhusbands, and regiments of servants, and kingdoms to govern; if\\nonly you act on the principle that the world is not for you and\\ndoes not inevitably need you, they can do you no harm. This very\\nyear some of your friends may have died. Is the world waiting\\nwithout going on, for them to come again? Is its current stopped?\\nNo, it goes on. So drive out of your mind the idea that you have to\\ndo something for the world; the world does not require any help\\nfrom you. It is sheer nonsense on the part of any man to think that\\nhe is born to help the world; it is simply pride, it is selfishness\\ninsinuating itself in the form of virtue. When you have trained\\nyour mind and your nerves to realise this idea of the world's non-\\ndependence on you or on anybody, there will then be no reaction\\nin the form of pain resulting from work. When you give\\nsomething to a man and expect nothing--do not even expect the\\nman to be grateful--his ingratitude will not tell upon you, because\\nyou never expected anything, never thought you had any right to\\nanything in the way of a return.

His great-\\ngrandfather had similarly tried and failed. He himself did not\\nsucceed perfectly, but his son, Shuka, was born perfect. Vyasa\\ntaught his son wisdom; and after teaching him the knowledge of\\ntruth himself, he sent him to the court of King Janaka. He was a\\ngreat king and was called Janaka Videha. Videha means \"without\\na body\". Although a king, he had entirely forgotten that he was a\\nbody; he felt that he was a spirit all the time. This boy Shuka was\\nsent to be taught by him. The king knew that Vyasa\\'s son was\\ncoming to him to learn wisdom: so he made certain arrangements\\nbeforehand. And when the boy presented himself at the gates of\\nthe palace, the guards took no notice of him whatsoever.

After that, suddenly, the ministers of the\\nking and all the big officials came there and received him with the\\ngreatest honours. They conducted him in and showed him into\\nsplendid rooms, gave him the most fragrant baths and wonderful\\ndresses, and for eight days they kept him there in all kinds of\\nluxury.

Any work, any action, any\\nthought that produces an effect is called a Karma. Thus the law of\\nKarma means the law of causation, of inevitable cause and\\nsequence. Wheresoever there is a cause, there an effect must be\\nproduced; this necessity cannot be resisted, and this law of Karma,\\naccording to our philosophy, is true throughout the whole\\nuniverse. Whatever we see, or feel, or do, whatever action there is\\nanywhere in the universe, while being the effect of past work on\\nthe one hand, becomes, on the other, a cause in its turn, and\\nproduces its own effect. It is necessary, together with this, to\\nconsider what is meant by the word \"law\". By law is meant the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (65 of', 'tendency of a series to repeat itself. When we see one event\\nfollowed by another, or sometimes happening simultaneously with\\nanother, we expect this sequence or co-existence to recur. Our old\\nlogicians and philosophers of the Nyaya school call this law by the\\nname of Vyapti. According to them, all our ideas of law are due to\\nassociation. A series of phenomena becomes associated with\\nthings in our mind in a sort of invariable order, so that whatever\\nwe perceive at any time is immediately referred to other facts in\\nthe mind. Any one idea or, according to our psychology, any one\\nwave that is produced in the mind-stuff, Chitta, must always give\\nrise to many similar waves. This is the psychological idea of\\nassociation, and causation is only as aspect of this grand pervasive\\nprinciple of association. This pervasiveness of association is what\\nis, in Sanskrit, called Vyapti. In the external world the idea of law\\nis the same as in the internal--the expectation that a particular\\nphenomenon will be followed by another, and that the series will\\nrepeat itself. Really speaking, therefore, law does not exist in\\nnature. Practically it is an error to say that gravitation exists in the\\nearth, or that there is any law existing objectively anywhere in\\nnature. Law is the method, the manner in which our mind grasps a\\nseries of phenomena; it is all in the mind. Certain phenomena,\\nhappening one after another or together, and followed by the\\nconviction of the regularity of their recurrence--thus enabling our\\nminds to grasp the method of the whole series--constitute what we\\ncall law.\\nThe next question for consideration is what we mean by law being\\nuniversal. Our universe is that portion of existence which is\\ncharacterised by what the Sanskrit psychologists call Desha-kala-\\nnimitta, or what is known to European psychology as space, time,\\nand causation. This universe is only a part of infinite existence,\\nthrown into a peculiar mould, composed of space, time, and\\ncausation. It necessarily follows that law is possible only within\\nthis conditioned universe; beyond it there cannot be any law.\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (66 of', 'When we speak of the universe, we only mean that portion of\\nexistence which is limited by our mind--the universe of the senses,\\nwhich we can see, feel, touch, hear, think of, imagine. This alone\\nis under law; but beyond it existence cannot be subject to law,\\nbecause causation does not extend beyond the world of our minds.\\nAnything beyond the range of our mind and our senses is not\\nbound by the law of causation, as there is no mental association of\\nthings in the region beyond the senses, and no causation without\\nassociation of ideas. It is only when \"being\" or existence gets\\nmoulded into name and form that it obeys the law of causation,\\nand is said to be under law; because all law has its essence in\\ncausation. Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such\\nthing as free will; the very words are a contradiction, because will\\nis what we know and everything that we know is within our\\nuniverse, and everything within our universe is mouled by the\\nconditions of space, time, and causation. Everything that we\\nknow, or can possibly know, must be subject to causation, and that\\nwhich obeys the law of causation cannot be free. It is acted upon\\nby other agents, and becomes a cause in its turn. But that which\\nhas become converted into the will, which was not the will before,\\nbut which, when it fell into this mould of space, time, and\\ncausation, became converted into the human will, is free; and\\nwhen this will gets out of this mould of space,time, and causation,\\nit will be free again. From freedom it comes, and becomes\\nmoulded into this bondage, and it gets out and goes back to\\nfreedom again.\\nThe question has been raised as to from whom this universe\\ncomes, in whom it rests, and to whom it goes; and the answer has\\nbeen given that from freedom it comes, in bondage it rests, and\\ngoes back into that freedom again. So, when we speak of man as\\nno other than that infinite being which is manifesting itself, we\\nmean that only one very small part thereof is man; this body and\\nthis mind which we see are only one part of the whole, only one\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (67 of', 'spot of the infinite being. This whole universe is only one speck of\\nthe infinite being; and all our laws, our bondages, our joys and our\\nsorrows, our happinesses and our expectations, are only within\\nthis small universe; all our progression and digression are within\\nits small compass. So you see how childish it is to expect a\\ncontinuation of this universe--the creation of our minds--and to\\nexpect to go to heaven, which after all must mean only a repetition\\nof this world that we know. You see at once that it is an\\nimpossible and childish desire to make the whole of infinite\\nexistence conform to the limited and conditioned existence which\\nwe know. When a man says that he will have again and again this\\nsame thing which he is having now, or, as I sometimes put it,\\nwhen he asks for a comfortable religion, you may know that he\\nhas become so degenerate that he cannot think of anything higher\\nthan what he is now; he is just his little present surroundings and\\nnothing more. He has forgotten his infinite nature, and his whole\\nidea is confined to these little joys, and sorrows, and heart-\\njealousies of the moment. He thinks that this finite thing is the\\ninfinite; and not only so, he will not let this foolishness go. He\\nclings on desperately unto Trishna, and the thirst after life, what\\nthe Buddhists call Tanha and Tissa. There may be millions of\\nkinds of happiness, and beings, and laws, and progress, and\\ncausation, all acting outside the little universe that we know; and,\\nafter all, the whole of this comprises but one section of our infinite\\nnature.\\nTo acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this\\nuniverse; it cannot be found here.

These little joys,\\nand sorrows, and knowledge of things end there, and the reality\\nbegins. Until we give up the thirst after life, the strong attachment\\nto this our transient conditioned existence, we have no hope of\\ncatching even a glimpse of that infinite freedom beyond. It stands\\nto reason then that there is only one way to attain to that freedom\\nwhich is the goal of all the noblest aspirations of mankind, and\\nthat is by giving up this little life, giving up this little universe,\\ngiving up this earth, giving up heaven, giving up the body, giving\\nup the mind, giving up everything that is limited and conditioned.\\nIf we give up our attachment to this little universe of the senses or\\nof the mind, we shall be free immediately. The only way to come\\nout of bondage is to go beyond the limitations of law, to go\\nbeyond causation.\\nBut it is a most difficult thing to give up the clinging to this\\nuniverse; few ever attain to that. There are two ways to do that\\nmentioned in our books. One is called the \"Neti, Neti\" (not this,\\nnot this), the other is called \"iti\" (this); the former is the negative,\\nand the latter is the positive way. The negative way is the most\\ndifficult. It is only possible to the men of the very highest,\\nexceptional minds and gigantic wills who simply stand up and say,\\n\"No, I will not have this,\" and the mind and body obey their will,\\nand they come out successful. But such people are very rare. The\\nvast majority of mankind choose the positive way, the way\\nthrough the world, making use of all the bondages themselves to\\nbreak those very bondages. This is also a kind of giving up; only it\\nis done slowly and gradually, by knowing things, enjoying things\\nand thus obtaining experience, and knowing the nature of things\\nuntil the mind lets them all go at last and becomes unattached. The\\nformer way of obtaining non-attachment is by reasoning, and the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (69 of', 'latter way is through work and experience. The first is the path of\\nJnana-Yoga and is characterised by the refusal to do any work; the\\nsecond is that of Karma-Yoga, in which there is no cessation from\\nwork. Every one must work in the universe. Only those who are\\nperfectly satisfied with the Self, whose desires do not go beyond\\nthe Self, whose mind never strays out of the Self, to whom the\\nSelf is all in all, only those do not work. The rest must work. A\\ncurrent rushing down of its own nature falls into a hollow and\\nmakes a whirlpool, and, after running a little in that whirlpool, it\\nemerges again in the form of the free current to go on unchecked.\\nEach human life is like that current. It gets into the whirl, gets\\ninvolved in this world of space, time, and causation, whirls round\\na little, crying out, \"my father, my brother, my name, my fame,\"\\nand so on, and at last emerges out of it and regains its original\\nfreedom. The whole universe is doing that. Whether we know it or\\nnot, whether we are conscious or unconscious of it, we are all\\nworking to get out of the dream of the world. Man\\'s experience in\\nthe world is to enable him to get out of its whirlpool.\\nWhat is Karma-Yoga? The knowledge of the secret of work. We\\nsee that the whole universe is working. For what? For salvation,\\nfor liberty; from the atom to the highest being, working for the one\\nend, liberty for the mind, for the body, for the spirit. All things are\\nalways trying to get freedom, flying away from bondage. The sun,\\nthe moon, the earth, the planets, all are trying to fly away from\\nbondage. The centrifugal and the centripetal forces of nature are\\nindeed typical of our universe. Instead of being knocked about in\\nthis universe, and after long delay and thrashing, getting to know\\nthings as they are, we learn from Karma-Yoga the secret of work,\\nthe method of work, the organising power of work. A vast mass of\\nenergy may be spent in vain if we do not know how to utilise it.\\nKarma- Yoga makes a science of work; you learn by it how best to\\nutilise all the workings of this world. Work is inevitable, it must\\nbe so; but we should work to the highest purpose.

There are no doubt\\nthese exceptional beings; but the rest of mankind have to go\\nslowing through the world of work. Karma-Yoga shows the\\nprocess, the secret, and the method of doing it to the best\\nadvantage.\\nWhat does it say? \"Work incessantly, but give up all attachment to\\nwork.\" Do not identify yourself with anything. Hold your mind\\nfree. All this that you see, the pains and the miseries, are but the\\nnecessary conditions of this world; poverty and wealth and\\nhappiness are but momentary; they do not belong to our real\\nnature at all. Our nature is far beyond misery and happiness,\\nbeyond every object of the senses, beyond the imagination; and\\nyet we must go on working all the time. \"Misery comes through\\nattachment, not through work.\" As soon as we identify ourselves\\nwith the work we do, we feel miserable; but if we do not identify\\nourselves with it, we do not feel that misery. If a beautiful picture\\nbelonging to another is burnt, a man does not generally become\\nmiserable; but when his own picture is burnt, how miserable he\\nfeels! Why? Both were beautiful pictures, perhaps copies of the\\nsame original; but in one case very much more misery is felt than\\nin the other. It is because in one case he identifies himself with the\\npicture, and not in the other. This \"I and mine\" causes the whole\\nmisery. With the sense of possession comes selfishness, and\\nselfishness brings on misery. Every act of selfishness or thought of\\nselfishness makes us attached to something, and immediately we\\nare made slaves. Each wave in the Chitta that says \"I and mine\"\\nimmediately puts a chain round us and makes us slaves; and the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (71 of', 'more we say \"I and mine\", the more slavery grows, the more\\nmisery increases. Therefore Karma-Yoga tells us to enjoy the\\nbeauty of all the pictures in the world, but not to identify ourselves\\nwith any of them. Never say \"mine\". Whenever we say a thing is\\n\"mine\", misery will immediately come. Do not even say \"my\\nchild\" in your mind. Possess the child, but do not say \"mine\". If\\nyou do, then will come the misery. Do not\\nsay \"my house,\" do not say \"my body\". The whole difficulty is\\nthere. The body is neither yours, nor mine, nor anybody\\'s. These\\nbodies are coming and going by the laws of nature, but we are\\nfree, standing as witness. This body is no more free than a picture\\nor a wall. Why should we be attached so much to a body? If\\nsomebody paints a picture, he does it and passes on. Do not\\nproject that tentacle of selfishness, \"I must possess it\". As soon as\\nthat is projected, misery will begin.\\nSo Karma-Yoga says, first destroy the tendency to project this\\ntentacle of selfishness, and when you have the power of checking\\nit, hold it in and do not allow the mind to get into the ways of\\nselfishness. Then you may go out into the world and work as\\nmuch as you can. Mix everywhere, go where you please; you will\\nnever be contaminated with evil. There is the lotus leaf in the\\nwater; the water cannot touch and adhere to it; so will you be in\\nthe world. This is called \"Vairagya\", dispassion or non-\\nattachment. I believe I have told you that without non-attachment\\nthere cannot be any kind of Yoga. Non-attachment is the basis of\\nall the Yogas. The man who gives up living in houses, wearing\\nfine clothes, and eating good food, and goes into the desert, may\\nbe a most attached person. His only possession, his own body,\\nmay become everything to him; and as he lives he will be simply\\nstruggling for the sake of his body. Non-attachment does not mean\\nanything that we may do in relation to our external body, it is all\\nin the mind. The binding link of \"I and mine\" is in the mind. If we\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (72 of', 'have not this link with the body and with the things of the senses,\\nwe are non-attached, wherever and whatever we may be. A man\\nmay be on a throne and perfectly non-attached; another man may\\nbe in rags and still very much attached. First, we have to attain this\\nstate of non-attachment and then to work incessantly. Karma-\\nYoga gives us the method that will help us in giving up all\\nattachment, though it is indeed very hard.\\nHere are the two ways of giving up all attachment. The one is for\\nthose who do not believe in God, or in any outside help. They are\\nleft to their own devices; they have simply to work with their own\\nwill, with the powers of their mind and discrimination, saying, \"I\\nmust be non-attached\". For those who believe in God there is\\nanother way, which is much less difficult. They give up the fruits\\nof work unto the Lord; they work and are never attached to the\\nresults. Whatever they see, feel, hear, or do, is for Him. For\\nwhatever good work we may do, let us not claim any praise or\\nbenefit. It is the Lord\\'s; give up the fruits unto Him. Let us stand\\naside and think that we are only servants obeying the Lord, our\\nMaster, and that every impulse for action comes from Him every\\nmoment. Whatever thou worshippest, whatever thou perceivest,\\nwhatever thou doest, give up all unto Him and be at rest. Let us be\\nat peace, perfect peace, with ourselves, and give up our whole\\nbody and mind and everything as an eternal sacrifice unto the\\nLord. Instead of the sacrifice of pouring oblations into the fire,\\nperform this one great sacrifice day and night--the sacrifice of\\nyour little self. \"In search of wealth in this world, Thou art the\\nonly wealth I have found; I sacrifice myself unto Thee. In search\\nof some one to be loved, Thou art the only one beloved I have\\nfound; I sacrifice myself unto Thee.\" Let us repeat this day and\\nnight, and say, \"Nothing for me; no matter whether the thing is\\ngood, bad, or indifferent; I do not care for it; I sacrifice all unto\\nThee.\" Day and night let us renounce our seeming self until it\\nbecomes a habit with us to do so, until it gets into the blood, the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (73 of', 'nerves, and the brain, and the whole body is every moment\\nobedient to this idea of self-renunciation.

Yet we\\nmay see that this peculiar sense of duty is very often a great cause\\nof misery. Duty becomes a disease with us; it drags us ever\\nforward. It catches hold of us and makes our whole life miserable.\\nIt is the bane of human life. This duty, this idea of duty is the\\nmidday summer sun which scorches the innermost soul of\\nmankind. Look at those poor slaves to duty! Duty leaves them no\\ntime to say prayers, no time to bathe. Duty is ever on them. They\\ngo out and work. Duty is on them!

This is duty as it is understood. The only true duty is to be\\nunattached and to work as free beings, to give up all work unto\\nGod. All our duties are His. Blessed are we that we are ordered\\nout here. We serve our time; whether we do it ill or well, who\\nknows? If we do it well, we do not get the fruits. If we do it ill,\\nneither do we get the care. Be at rest, be free, and work. This kind\\nof freedom is a very hard thing to attain. How easy it is to interpret\\nslavery as duty--the morbid attachment of flesh for flesh as duty!\\nMen go out into the world and struggle and fight for money or for\\nany other thing to which they get attached. Ask them why they do\\nit. They say, \"It is a duty.\" It is the absurd greed for gold and gain,\\nand they try to cover it with a few flowers.\\nWhat is duty after all? It is really the impulsion of the flesh, of our\\nattachment; and when an attachment has become established, we\\ncall it duty. For instance, in countries where there is no marriage,\\nthere is no duty between husband and wife; when marriage comes,\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (74 of', \"husband and wife live together on account of attachment; and that\\nkind of living together becomes settled after generations; and\\nwhen it becomes so settled, it becomes a duty.

So when attachment\\nbecomes chronic, we baptise it with the high-sounding name of\\nduty. We strew flowers upon it, trumpets sound for it, sacred texts\\nare said over it, and then the whole world fights, and men\\nearnestly rob each other for this duty's sake. Duty is good to the\\nextent that it checks brutality. To the lowest kinds of men, who\\ncannot have any other ideal, it is of some good; but those who\\nwant to be Karma Yogis must throw this idea of duty overboard.\\nThere is no duty for you and me.

If you want the reward, you must also\\nhave the punishment; the only way to get out of the punishment is\\nto give up the reward. The only way of getting out of misery is by\\ngiving up the idea of happiness, because these two are linked to\\neach other. On one side there is happiness, on the other there is\\nmisery. On one side there is life, on the other there is death. The\\nonly way to get beyond death is to give up the love of life. Life\\nand death are the same thing, looked at from different points. So\\nthe idea of happiness without misery, or of life without death, is\\nvery good for school-boys and children; but the thinker sees that it\\nis all a contradiction in terms and gives up both.

But you must, at the same time, remember that these\\ndivisions are not very marked and quite exclusive of each other.\\nEach blends into the other. But according to the type which\\nprevails, we name the divisions. It is not that you can find men\\nwho have no other faculty than that of work, nor that you can find\\nmen who are no more than devoted worshippers only, nor that\\nthere are men who have no more than mere knowledge. These\\ndivisions are made in accordance with the type or the tendency\\nthat may be seen to prevail in a man. We have found that, in the\\nend, all these four paths converge and become one. All religions\\nand all methods of work and worship lead us to one and the same\\ngoal. I have already tried to point out that goal. It is freedom as I\\nunderstand it. Everything that we perceive around us is struggling\\ntowards freedom, from the atom to the man, from the insentient,\\nlifeless particle of matter to the highest existence on earth, the\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (78 of', 'human soul. The whole universe is in fact the result of this\\nstruggle for freedom. In all combinations every particle is trying to\\ngo on its own way, to fly from the other particles; but the others\\nare holding it in check. Our earth is trying to fly away from the\\nsun, and the moon from the earth. Everything has a tendency to\\ninfinite dispersion. All that we see in the universe has for its basis\\nthis one struggle towards freedom; it is under the impulse of this\\ntendency that the saint prays and the robber robs. When the line of\\naction taken is not a proper one, we call it evil; and when the\\nmanifestation of it is proper and high, we call it good. But the\\nimpulse is the same, the struggle towards freedom. The saint is\\noppressed with the knowledge of his condition of bondage, and he\\nwants to get rid of it; so he worships God. The thief is oppressed\\nwith the idea that he does not possess certain things, and he tries\\nto get rid of that want, to obtain freedom from it; so he steals.\\nFreedom is the one goal of all nature, sentient or insentient; and\\nconsciously or unconsciously, everything is struggling towards\\nthat goal. The freedom which the saint seeks is very different from\\nthat which the robber seeks; the freedom loved by the saint leads\\nhim to the enjoyment of infinite, unspeakable bliss, while that on\\nwhich the robber has set his heart only forges other bonds for his\\nsoul.\\nThere is to be found in every religion the manifestation of this\\nstruggle towards freedom. It is the groundwork of all morality, of\\nunselfishness, which means getting rid of the idea that men are the\\nsame as their little body. When we see a man doing good work,\\nhelping others, it means that he cannot be confined within the\\nlimited circle of \"me and mine\". There is no limit to this getting\\nout of selfishness. All the great systems of ethics preach absolute\\nunselfishness as the goal. Supposing this absolute unselfishness\\ncan be reached by a man, what becomes of him? He is no more the\\nlittle Mr. So-and-so; he has acquired infinite expansion. The little\\npersonality which he had before is now lost to him for ever; he has\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (79 of', 'become infinite, and the attainment of this infinite expansion is\\nindeed the goal of all religions and of all moral and philosophical\\nteachings. The personalist, when he hears this idea philosophically\\nput, gets frightened. At the same time, if he preaches morality, he\\nafter all teaches the very same idea himself. He puts no limit to the\\nunselfishness of man. Suppose a man becomes perfectly unselfish\\nunder the personalistic system, how are we to distinguish him\\nfrom the perfected ones in other systems? He has become one with\\nthe universe and to become that is the goal of all; only the poor\\npersonalist has not the courage to follow out his own reasoning to\\nits right conclusion. Karma-Yoga is the attaining through unselfish\\nwork of that freedom which is the goal of all human nature. Every\\nselfish action, therefore, retards our reaching the goal, and every\\nunselfish action takes us towards the goal; that is why the only\\ndefinition that can be given of morality is this: That which is\\nselfish is immoral, and that which is unselfish is moral.\\nBut, if you come to details, the matter will not be seen to be quite\\nso simple. For instance, environment often makes the details\\ndifferent as I have already mentioned. The same action under one\\nset of circumstances may be unselfish, and under another set quite\\nselfish. So we can give only a general definition, and leave the\\ndetails to be worked out by taking into consideration the\\ndifferences in time, place, and circumstances. In one country one\\nkind of conduct is considered moral, and in another the very same\\nis immoral, because the circumstances differ. The goal of all\\nnature is freedom, and freedom is to be attained only by perfect\\nunselfishness; every thought, word, or deed that is unselfish takes\\nus towards the goal, and, as such, is called moral. That definition,\\nyou will find, holds good in every religion and every system of\\nethics. In some systems of thought morality is derived from a\\nSuperior Being--God. If you ask why a man ought to do this and\\nnot that, their answer is : \"Because such is the command of God.\"\\nBut whatever be the source from which it is derived, their code of\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (80 of', 'ethics also has the same central idea--not to think of self but to\\ngive up self. And yet some persons, in spite of this high ethical\\nidea, are frightened at the thought of having to give up their little\\npersonalities. We may ask the man who clings to the idea of little\\npersonalities to consider the case of a person who has become\\nperfectly unselfish, who has no thought for himself, who does no\\ndeed for himself, who speaks no word for himself, and then say\\nwhere his \"himself\" is. That \"himself\" is known to him only so\\nlong as he thinks, acts, or speaks for himself. If he is only\\nconscious of others, of the universe, and of the all, where is his\\n\"himself\"? It is gone forever.\\nKarma-Yoga, therefore, is a system of ethics and religion intended\\nto attain freedom through unselfishness, and by good works. The\\nKarma-Yogi need not believe in any doctrine whatever. He may\\nnot believe even in God, may not ask what his soul is, nor think of\\nany metaphysical speculation. He has got his own special aim of\\nrealising selflessness; and he has to work it out himself. Every\\nmoment of his life must be realisation, because he has to solve by\\nmere work, without the help of doctrine or theory, the very same\\nproblem to which the Jnani applies his reason and inspiration and\\nthe Bhakta his love.\\nNow comes the next question: What is this work? What is this\\ndoing good to the world? Can we do good to the world? In an\\nabsolute sense, no; in a relative sense, yes. No permanent or\\neverlasting good can be done to the world; if it could be done, the\\nworld would not be this world. We may satisfy the hunger of a\\nman for five minutes, but he will be hungry again. Every pleasure\\nwith which we supply a man may be seen to be momentary. No\\none can permanently cure this ever-recurring fever of pleasure and\\npain. Can any permanent happiness be given to the world? In the\\nocean we cannot raise a wave without causing a hollow\\nsomewhere else. The sum total of the good things in the world has\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (81 of', \"been the same throughout in its relation to man's need and greed.\\nIt cannot be increased or decreased. Take the history of the human\\nrace as we know it today. Do we not find the same miseries and\\nthe same happiness, the same pleasures and pains, the same\\ndifferences in position? Are not some rich, some poor, some high,\\nsome low, some healthy, some unhealthy? All this was just the\\nsame with the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans in ancient\\ntimes as it is with the Americans today. So far as history is known,\\nit has always been the same; yet at the same time we find that,\\nrunning along with all these incurable differences of pleasure and\\npain, there has ever been the struggle to alleviate them. Every\\nperiod of history has given birth to thousands of men and women\\nwho have worked hard to smooth the passage of life for others.\\nAnd how far have they succeeded? We can only play at driving\\nthe ball from one place to another. We take away pain from the\\nphysical plane, and it goes to the mental one. It is like that picture\\nin Dante's hell where the misers were given a mass of gold to roll\\nup a hill. Every time they rolled it up a little, it again rolled down.\\nAll our talks about the millennium are very nice as school-boys'\\nstories, but they are no better than that. All nations that dream of\\nthe millennium also think that, of all peoples in the world, they\\nwill have the best of it then for themselves. This is the\\nwonderfully unselfish idea of the millennium!\\nWe cannot add happiness to this world; similarly, we cannot add\\npain to it either. The sum total of the energies of pleasure and pain\\ndisplayed here on earth will be the same throughout. We just push\\nit from this side to the other side, and from that side to this, but it\\nwill remain the same, because to remain so is its very nature. This\\nebb and flow, this rising and falling, is in the world's very nature;\\nit would be as logical to hold otherwise as to say that we may have\\nlife without death. This is complete nonsense, because the very\\nidea of life implies death and the very idea of pleasure implies\\npain. The lamp is constantly burning out, and that is its life.

Life and\\ndeath are only different expressions of the same thing looked at\\nfrom different standpoints; they are the falling and the rising of the\\nsame wave, and the two form one whole. One looks at the \"fall\"\\nside and becomes a pessimist, another looks at the \"rise\" side and\\nbecomes an optimist. When a boy is going to school and his father\\nand mother are taking care of him, everything seems blessed to\\nhim; his wants are simple, he is a great optimist. But the old man,\\nwith his varied experience, becomes calmer, and is sure to have\\nhis warmth considerably cooled down. So, old nations, with signs\\nof decay all around them, are apt to be less hopeful than new\\nnations. There is a proverb in India: \"A thousand years a city, and\\na thousand years a forest.\" This change of city into forest and vice\\nversa is going on everywhere, and it makes people optimists or\\npessimists according to the side they see of it.\\nThe next idea we take up is the idea of equality. These millennium\\nideas have been great motive powers to work. Many religions\\npreach this an an element in them--that God is coming to rule the\\nuniverse, and that then there will be no difference at all in\\nconditions. The people who preach this doctrine are mere fanatics,\\nand fanatics are indeed the sincerest of mankind. Christianity was\\npreached just on the basis of the fascination of this fanaticism, and\\nthat is what made it so attractive to the Greek and the Roman\\nslaves. They believed that under the millennial religion there\\nwould be no more slavery, that there would be plenty to eat and\\ndrink; and, therefore, they flocked round the Christian standard.\\nThose who preached the idea first were of course ignorant\\nfanatics, but very sincere. In modern times this millennial\\naspiration takes the form of equality--of liberty, equality, and\\nfraternity. This is also fanaticism. True equality has never been\\nand never can be on earth. How can we all be equal here? This\\nimpossible kind of equality implies total death. What makes this\\nworld what it is? Lost balance. In the primal state, which is called\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (83 of', 'chaos, there is perfect balance. How do all the formative forces of\\nthe universe come then? By struggling, competition, conflict.\\nSuppose that all the particles of matter were held in equilibrium,\\nwould there be then any process of creation? We know from\\nscience that it is impossible. Disturb a sheet of water, and there\\nyou find every particle of the water trying to become calm again,\\none rushing against the other; and in the same way all the\\nphenomena which we call the universe--all things therein--are\\nstruggling to get back to the state of perfect balance. Again a\\ndisturbance comes, and again we have combination and creation.\\nInequality is the very basis of creation. At the same time the forces\\nstruggling to obtain equality are as much a necessity of creation as\\nthose which destroy it.\\nAbsolute equality, that which means a perfect balance of all the\\nstruggling forces in all the planes, can never be in this world.\\nBefore you attain that state, the world will have become quite\\nunfit for any kind of life, and no one will be there. We find,\\ntherefore, that all these ideas of the millennium and of absolute\\nequality are not only impossible but also that, if we try to carry\\nthem out, they will lead us surely enough to the day of destruction.\\nWhat makes the difference between man and man? It is largely the\\ndifference in the brain. Nowadays no one but a lunatic will say\\nthat we are all born with the same brain power. We come into the\\nworld with unequal endowments; we come as greater men or as\\nlesser men, and there is no getting away from that pre-natally\\ndetermined condition. The American Indians were in this country\\nfor thousands of years, and a few handfuls of your ancestors came\\nto their land. What difference they have caused in the appearance\\nof the country! Why did not the Indians make improvements and\\nbuild cities, if all were equal? With your ancestors a different sort\\nof brain power came into the land, different bundles of past\\nimpressions came, and they worked out and manifested\\nthemselves. Absolute non-differentiation is death. So long as this\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (84 of', \"world lasts, differentiation there will and must be, and the\\nmillennium of perfect equality will come only when a cycle of\\ncreation comes to its end. Before that, equality cannot be. Yet this\\nidea of realising the millennium is a great motive power. Just as\\ninequality is necessary for creation itself, so the struggle to limit it\\nis also necessary. If there were no struggle to become free and get\\nback to God, there would be no creation either. It is the difference\\nbetween these two forces that determines the nature of the motives\\nof men. There will always be these motives to work, some tending\\ntowards bondage and others towards freedom.\\nThis world's wheel within wheel is a terrible mechanism; if we put\\nour hands in it, as soon as we are caught we are gone. We all think\\nthat when we have done a certain duty, we shall be at rest; but\\nbefore we have done a part of that duty, another is already in\\nwaiting. We are all being dragged along by this mighty, complex\\nworld-machine. There are only two ways out of it; one is to give\\nup all concerns with the machine, to let it go and stand aside, to\\ngive up our desires. That is very easy to say, but is almost\\nimpossible to do. I do not know whether in twenty millions of men\\none can do that.

The Karma Yogi asks why you require any\\nmotive to work other than the inborn love of freedom. Be beyond\\nthe common worldly motives. \"To work you have the right, but\\nnot to the fruits thereof.\" Man can train himself to know and to\\npractise that, says the Karma Yogi. When the idea of doing good\\nbecomes a part of his very being, then he will not seek for any\\nmotive outside. Let us do good because it is good to do good; he\\nwho does good work even in order to get to heaven binds himself\\ndown, says the Karma Yogi. Any work that is done with any the\\nleast selfish motive, instead of making us free, forges one more\\nchain for our feet.\\nSo the only way is to give up all the fruits of work, to be\\nunattached to them. Know that this world is not we, nor are we\\nthis world; that we are really not the body; that we really do not\\nwork. We are the Self, eternally at rest and at peace. Why should\\nwe be bound by anything? It is very good to say that we should be\\nperfectly non-attached, but what is the way to do it? Every good\\nwork we do without any ulterior motive, instead of forging a new\\nchain, will break one of the links in the existing chains. Every\\ngood thought that we send to the world without thinking of any\\nreturn, will be stored up there and break one link in the chain, and\\nmake us purer and purer, until we become the purest of mortals.\\nYet all this may seem to be rather quixotic and too philosophical,\\nmore theoretical than practical. I have read many arguments\\nagainst the Bhagavad-Gita, and many have said that without\\nmotives you cannot work.

All the prophets of the world, except Buddha, had\\nexternal motives to move them to unselfish action. The prophets\\nof the world, with this single exception, may be divided into two\\nsets, one set holding that they are incarnations of God come down\\non earth, and the other holding that they are only messengers from\\nGod; and both draw their impetus for work from outside, expect\\nreward from outside, however highly spiritual may be the\\nlanguage they use. But Buddha is the only prophet who said, \"I do\\nnot care to know your various theories about God. What is the use\\nof discussing all the subtle doctrines about the soul? Do good and\\nbe good. And this will take you to freedom and to whatever truth\\nthere is.\" He was, in the conduct of his life, absolutely without\\npersonal motives; and what man worked more than he?

This great philosopher,\\npreaching the highest philosophy, yet had the deepest sympathy\\nfor the lowest of animals, and never put forth any claims for\\nhimself.

The greatest weakness\\noften insinuates itself as the greatest good and strength. It is a\\nweakness to think that any one is dependent on me, and that I can\\ndo good to another. This belief is the mother of all our attachment,\\nand through this attachment comes all our pain. We must inform\\nour minds that no one in this universe depends upon us; not one\\nbeggar depends on our charity; not one soul on our kindness; not\\none living thing on our help. All are helped on by nature, and will\\nbe so helped even though millions of us were not here. The course\\nof nature will not stop for such as you and me; it is, as already\\npointed out, only a blessed privilege to you and to me that we are\\nallowed, in the way of helping others, to educate ourselves. This\\nis a great lesson to learn in life, and when we have learned it fully,\\nwe shall never be unhappy; we can go and mix without harm in\\nsociety anywhere and everywhere. You may have wives and\\nhusbands, and regiments of servants, and kingdoms to govern; if\\nonly you act on the principle that the world is not for you and\\ndoes not inevitably need you, they can do you no harm. This very\\nyear some of your friends may have died. Is the world waiting\\nwithout going on, for them to come again? Is its current stopped?\\nNo, it goes on. So drive out of your mind the idea that you have to\\ndo something for the world; the world does not require any help\\nfrom you. It is sheer nonsense on the part of any man to think that\\nhe is born to help the world; it is simply pride, it is selfishness\\ninsinuating itself in the form of virtue. When you have trained\\nyour mind and your nerves to realise this idea of the world's non-\\ndependence on you or on anybody, there will then be no reaction\\nin the form of pain resulting from work. When you give\\nsomething to a man and expect nothing--do not even expect the\\nman to be grateful--his ingratitude will not tell upon you, because\\nyou never expected anything, never thought you had any right to\\nanything in the way of a return. You gave him what he deserved;\\nhis own Karma got it for him; your Karma made you the carrier\\nthereof.

That is self-\\nabnegation. The philosopher, with his knowledge, sees that the\\nseeming self is a delusion and easily gives it up. It is self-\\nabnegation. So Karma, Bhakti, and Jnana all meet here; and this is\\nwhat was meant by all the great preachers of ancient times, when\\nthey taught that God is not the world. There is one thing which is\\nthe world and another which is God; and this distinction is very\\ntrue. What they mean by world is selfishness. Unselfishness is\\nGod. One may live on a throne, in a golden palace, and be\\nperfectly unselfish; and then he is in God. Another may live in a\\nhut and wear rags, and have nothing in the world; yet, if he is\\nselfish, he is intensely merged in the world.\\nTo come back to one of our main points, we say that we cannot do\\ngood without at the same time doing some evil, or do evil without\\ndoing some good. Knowing this, how can we work? There have,\\ntherefore, been sects in this world who have in an astoundingly\\npreposterous way preached slow suicide as the only means to get\\nout of the world, because if a man lives, he has to kill poor little\\nanimals and plants or do injury to something or some one. So\\naccording to them the only way out of the world is to die. The\\nJains have preached this doctrine as their highest ideal. This\\nteaching seems to be very logical. But the true solution is found in\\nthe Gita. It is the theory of non-attachment, to be attached to\\nnothing while doing our work of life. Know that you are separated\\nentirely from the world, though you are in the world, and that\\nwhatever you may be doing in it, you are not doing that for your\\nown sake. Any action that you do for yourself will bring its effect\\nto bear upon you. If it is a good action, you will have to take the\\ngood effect, and if bad, you will have to take the bad effect; but\\nany action that is not done for your own sake, whatever it be, will\\nhave no effect on you. There is to be found a very expressive\\nsentence in our scriptures embodying this idea: \"Even if he kill\\nthe whole universe (or be himself killed), he is neither the killer\\nfile:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Chitra%20Sel...vekananda/BooksBySwami/KarmaYoga/KarmaYogaPDF.html (59 of', 'for fanatics; but we must know that fanaticism brings forth as\\nmuch evil as good. The Karma Yogi asks why you require any\\nmotive to work other than the inborn love of freedom. Be beyond\\nthe common worldly motives. \"To work you have the right, but\\nnot to the fruits thereof.\" Man can train himself to know and to\\npractise that, says the Karma Yogi. When the idea of doing good\\nbecomes a part of his very being, then he will not seek for any\\nmotive outside. Let us do good because it is good to do good; he\\nwho does good work even in order to get to heaven binds himself\\ndown, says the Karma Yogi. Any work that is done with any the\\nleast selfish motive, instead of making us free, forges one more\\nchain for our feet.\\nSo the only way is to give up all the fruits of work, to be\\nunattached to them. Know that this world is not we, nor are we\\nthis world; that we are really not the body; that we really do not\\nwork. We are the Self, eternally at rest and at peace. Why should\\nwe be bound by anything? It is very good to say that we should be\\nperfectly non-attached, but what is the way to do it? Every good\\nwork we do without any ulterior motive, instead of forging a new\\nchain, will break one of the links in the existing chains. Every\\ngood thought that we send to the world without thinking of any\\nreturn, will be stored up there and break one link in the chain, and\\nmake us purer and purer, until we become the purest of mortals.\\nYet all this may seem to be rather quixotic and too philosophical,\\nmore theoretical than practical. I have read many arguments\\nagainst the Bhagavad-Gita, and many have said that without\\nmotives you cannot work. They have never seen unselfish work\\nexcept under the influence of fanaticism, and, therefore, they\\nspeak in that way.\\nLet me tell you in conclusion a few words about one man who\\nactually carried this teaching of Karma-Yoga into practice.
